## Scientific Question  
<br/>
What are the metabolic processes and mechanisms involved in diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease, particularly with respect to innate lymphocytes?

## ILC Metabolism: From Systemic to Single-Cell Insights  

The research paradigm has shifted from organism-level metabolic analysis to single-cell resolution. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, particularly single-cell RNA-seq, researchers can now dissect the metabolic and transcriptional profiles of specific immune and non-immune cells in health and disease. This enables targeted metabolic interventions in conditions like diabetes, obesity, and colitis.

# Metabolic Dysregulation in Diseases and the Role of Intermittent Fasting: A Focus on Diabetes, Obesity, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)  

Metabolism—defined as the ensemble of biochemical reactions sustaining cellular life—is vital for systemic homeostasis. Dysregulation of metabolic pathways contributes to various chronic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These conditions not only disrupt cellular metabolism but also alter immune homeostasis, exacerbating disease progression. Recently, intermittent fasting (IF) has gained attention as a strategy capable of simultaneously modulating metabolic and immune function, thus representing a promising therapeutic avenue.

## Diabetes and Metabolic Dysfunction  

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia caused by insulin resistance and/or impaired insulin secretion. This metabolic dysfunction contributes to severe complications including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and neuropathy, which are aggravated by systemic low-grade inflammation. Aberrant glucose and lipid metabolism also impairs immune cell function, enhancing inflammatory activity. Emerging evidence suggests that intermittent fasting improves insulin sensitivity, lowers inflammation, and helps reestablish metabolic homeostasis, thereby offering benefits for diabetes management.

## Obesity and Its Impact on Metabolism  

Obesity is marked by excessive adipose accumulation and is a key risk factor for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Adipose tissue in obesity becomes inflamed due to infiltration by proinflammatory immune cells, further fueling systemic insulin resistance. Intermittent fasting has shown efficacy in reducing fat mass, improving insulin responsiveness, and dampening chronic inflammation, making it a viable metabolic intervention.

## Intermittent Fasting: A Modulator of Metabolism and Immune Function  

Intermittent fasting (IF)—periodic alternation between feeding and fasting—modulates metabolic and immune parameters by enhancing insulin sensitivity, increasing fat oxidation, and lowering systemic inflammation. Notably, IF may reprogram immune cells metabolically, shifting their activation and cytokine production patterns. It may also improve gut microbiota composition, with potential therapeutic implications in diseases like IBD.

## Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Metabolic Shifts  

IBD, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. While immune dysregulation is central to its pathology, IBD also causes significant metabolic perturbations such as altered nutrient utilization and gut dysbiosis. These changes further aggravate inflammation and systemic health. Intermittent fasting may reduce intestinal inflammation, restore epithelial integrity, and rebalance the microbiome, thereby serving as an adjunct to conventional IBD treatments.

## Innate Lymphoid Cells and Their Metabolic Adaptations  

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are key regulators of mucosal immunity and tissue repair. They exhibit unique metabolic profiles that are shaped by their tissue environment and the presence of disease. In inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and IBD, ILCs undergo metabolic reprogramming—often shifting toward aerobic glycolysis (a phenomenon reminiscent of the Warburg effect). This metabolic plasticity enables rapid energy generation to sustain their effector functions. Intermittent fasting may modulate ILC metabolism and activation, presenting a novel immunometabolic intervention.

> In conclusion, metabolic dysregulation in diabetes, obesity, and IBD profoundly impacts immune homeostasis. A deeper understanding of the metabolic pathways underpinning ILC function may yield novel therapeutic strategies, especially through interventions like intermittent fasting.
