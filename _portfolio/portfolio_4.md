title: "Skin Innate Lymphoid Cells: Physiological and Pathological Roles"
excerpt: "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident lymphocytes that lack rearranged antigen receptors. Cutaneous ILCs, mainly ILC2s, are essential for sustaining tissue equilibrium, contributing to physiological and pathological roles. Here, this review explores the characteristics of cutaneous ILCs in different conditions. This review highlights the role of skin ILCs in maintaining tissue homeostasis by regulating microbiome balance. It examines how their dysfunction can lead to inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and melanoma. ILC-related factors contribute to physiological functions and their implications in various pathological conditions, potentially highlighting key areas for future research. We now explore how these studies have enhanced our understanding of ILC regulation and the potential therapeutic applications of targeting these cells in skin inflammation based on microbiota and metabolism.<br/><img src='/images/Skin_ILCs/Development.png'>"

## Scientific Question
In healthy individuals, the majority of effector cutaneous ILCs are ILC2s. How and when do the amounts of ILC2s and ILC3s change during disease progression, and how do the master regulators Gata3 and Rortt regulate cell fate and function of ILC2s and ILC3s?

## Background
# ILCs Development
ILCs are closely associated with T cells and arise from common lymphoid precursors (CLPs). Through the influence of crucial transcription factors, CLPs undergo stepwise differentiation into common innate lymphoid progenitors (CILPs), common helper innate lymphoid progenitors (CHILPs), and other lymphoid progenitors. Ultimately, these progenitors differentiate into various types of ILCs.<br/>

# Skin ILCs and Hair Follicle
Hair follicles (HFs) are integral to hair growth, with immune system interactions playing a key role in their function. Skin-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), particularly ILC2s, influence HF activity by regulating stem cell proliferation and hair cycling. IL-13 from ILC2s modulates the hair cycle, while ILCs also affect sebaceous gland function and microbial homeostasis, impacting hair growth. Dysregulation of Notch signaling, involving ILCs, can lead to hair follicle damage and alopecia. Furthermore, GATA3-expressing ILC2s are crucial for the regeneration of HFs, promoting hair regrowth through their influence on RORγtfm+ ILC2s. These interactions underscore the pivotal role of ILCs in both hair follicle maintenance and microbial balance in the skin.<br/>

# Skin ILCs and Tissue Repair
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play a critical role in tissue repair, particularly in the skin, by regulating immune responses and promoting healing. ILC2s, activated by IL-33, are essential for skin repair, enhancing tissue regeneration after dermal injury. ILC3s, recruited via Notch1 signaling and TNFα-related mechanisms, contribute to epidermal proliferation and macrophage recruitment through the production of CCL3 and IL-17F. Additionally, ILC3s regulate tissue repair via GPR34 and IL-22 secretion, which facilitates homeostasis. In contrast, NK cells can negatively impact skin repair, with their absence accelerating wound closure. Overall, ILCs maintain skin homeostasis and are vital in orchestrating effective tissue repair, with dysregulation in pathological conditions affecting their function.<br/>

# Skin ILCs and Atopic Dermatitis/Psoriasis
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by chronic skin inflammation driven by immune system dysfunction, particularly involving type 2 immunity and innate immune cells. ILC2s, especially the CRTH2+ subset, play a pivotal role in AD pathology by secreting IL-5 and IL-13, promoting inflammation. E-cadherin downregulation is a key mechanism in this process. IL-33-induced inflammation, resembling AD, relies on the interaction between ILC2s and eosinophils, with reduced eosinophil populations leading to diminished ILC2 responses. Additionally, NK cell depletion in AD patients exacerbates type 2 inflammation, while NK cell augmentation through IL-15 improves AD symptoms. Thus, ILCs, especially ILC2s, are central to the immune dysregulation observed in AD.<br/>
Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) share immune dysregulation but involve distinct immune cell populations and mechanisms. In psoriasis, ILC3s, particularly NKp44+ and NKp44− subsets, play a key role in plaque formation by producing IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. The transition of ILC2s to IL-17-producing cells within psoriatic lesions suggests plasticity between ILC2s and ILC3s in disease pathology. IL-23-driven activation of tissue-resident ILCs, including ILC2s, promotes a convergent inflammatory program characterized by IL-13 and IL-22 or IL-17A production. Targeting the transformation of ILCs into pathogenic ILC3s offers potential therapeutic strategies for psoriasis.<br/>

# Skin ILCs and Cutaneous Melanoma
Cutaneous melanoma involves complex interactions between immune cells, particularly NK cells and ILCs, which influence tumor progression and response to immunotherapy. NK cells, including CD56dim CD57+ subsets, exhibit tumor-killing cytotoxicity, but their functionality can be suppressed by factors like prostaglandin E2 and loss of NK-associated gene features, contributing to immune escape and poor prognosis. ILC1s, present in melanoma patients, show impaired cytokine secretion due to immune microenvironment alterations caused by kynurenine and adenosine. In contrast, ILC2s, which are associated with favorable prognosis, promote tumor immunity via GM-CSF-driven eosinophil accumulation, though high PD-1 expression limits their anti-tumor activity. IL-33 induction and anti-PD-1 therapy can enhance ILC2 function, while tumor-derived lactate negatively impacts ILC2 survival, suggesting lactate as a potential target for melanoma treatment.


## Begining
My research supervisor, Chao Zhong, worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the NIH Jinfang Zhu laboratory, where he published three papers (*Immunity. 2014 Mar 20;40(3):378-88*; *Nat Immunol. 2016 Feb;17(2):169-78*; *Immunity. 2020 Jan 14;52(1):83-95.e4*). Due to challenges with the preparation of single-cell suspensions of skin ILCs at that time, corresponding scientific questions could not be addressed. Later, he established a lab at Peking University, where he mentored Guanqun Ren in developing a system for preparing single-cell suspensions from skin, enabling the exploration of Skin ILCs.<br/>
We constructed Rorc Fate-mapping mice and discovered that the proportion of Rorc Fate-mapping ILC2s in the skin was higher than in other tissues, which served as the starting point for our research on skin ILCs. At the time, a major challenge was identifying disease models to explore the functional roles of these Rorc Fate-mapping ILC2s. While sequencing technologies were well utilized, the application of pathology slides was not fully developed. My contributions to this research primarily involved assisting in the acquisition of skin ILC single-cell suspensions and applying bioinformatics.<br/>
