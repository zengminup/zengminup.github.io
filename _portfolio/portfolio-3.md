## Scientific Question  
**How Does IL-18 Regulate Intestinal Homeostasis?**<br/><br/>

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine significantly upregulated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and implicated in modulating innate lymphoid cell (ILC) phenotypes within the intestinal mucosa. Here, through comprehensive analyses integrating spatial transcriptomics, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional murine models, IL-18 is demonstrated to facilitate the plasticity of CCR6⁻ ILC3s towards an ILC1 phenotype characterized by increased IL-18 receptor 1 (IL18R1) expression. IL-18 deficiency does not alter acute colitis severity but attenuates pathology during repeated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, underscoring its role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Mechanistically, IL-18 preferentially acts on IL-22 fate-mapping negative ILC3 subsets to promote transdifferentiation without impairing IL-22 production. These findings reveal a critical IL-18/IL18R1 signaling axis governing ILC plasticity that contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation in IBD.


## Background
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), represents a group of chronic, relapsing-remitting inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is characterized by aberrant mucosal immune responses to commensal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to sustained intestinal inflammation, epithelial barrier disruption, and progressive tissue damage. Clinically, CD can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract with transmural inflammation and granuloma formation, while UC is typically confined to the colon and limited to mucosal layers.<br/><br/>
Over the past several decades, the global incidence and prevalence of IBD have markedly increased, particularly in newly industrialized countries, signifying the role of environmental and lifestyle factors in disease pathogenesis. According to epidemiological estimates, more than 6 million individuals worldwide are affected by IBD, imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems due to its chronic course, need for lifelong therapy, and frequent complications such as fibrosis, strictures, and colorectal cancer.<br/><br/>
**IBD Epidemiology**<br/><img src="/images/IL18_all/Epidemiology.png"><br/>

Advances in high-throughput technologies, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics, and proteomics, have significantly enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IBD pathogenesis. GWAS have identified over 200 susceptibility loci associated with IBD, many of which converge on immune regulatory pathways, including cytokine signaling, innate immune activation, and epithelial barrier integrity. Among the cytokines highlighted by these integrative analyses, interleukin-18 (IL-18), a member of the IL-1 family, has emerged as a critical player.<br/><br/>

IL-18 is constitutively expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and is rapidly processed into its active form upon inflammasome activation, particularly via NLRP3 and caspase-1. Functional multi-omics approaches have revealed upregulation of IL-18 in inflamed intestinal tissues of IBD patients, with proteomic data corroborating its increased secretion in both mucosal biopsies and serum samples. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomic studies have demonstrated compartmentalized expression of IL-18 within the intestinal epithelium, suggesting a tissue-intrinsic role in epithelial-immune cell crosstalk.<br/><br/>

Collectively, these findings implicate IL-18 as a key mediator in the interface between epithelial stress responses and immune activation in the gut, highlighting the need to delineate its context-dependent roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis versus promoting inflammation.<br/><br/>

The cytokine **interleukin-18 (IL-18)** has emerged as a key immunoregulatory molecule with diverse functions spanning host defense, epithelial integrity, tumor immunity, and immune tolerance. A series of landmark studies have collectively shaped our current understanding of IL-18 biology.

**1. Discovery and Functional Identity**<br/>
IL-18 was originally described as *interferon-γ–inducing factor (IGIF)* in a foundational study published in *Nature* (1995), which identified its role in promoting *Th1 responses*. Follow-up studies demonstrated the synergistic effect of *IL-12 and IL-18* in driving IFN-γ production (*J Immunol*, 1998), establishing IL-18 as a central bridge between innate and adaptive immunity.<br/>
**2. Upstream Activation Mechanisms**<br/>
The secretion of bioactive IL-18 requires proteolytic cleavage of its precursor form by *inflammasome-activated caspases*. *Caspase-1*–dependent processing was elucidated in early studies (*Nature*, 2017), while later work revealed *caspase-4* as a non-canonical IL-18 activator (*Nature*, 2023). *Gasdermin D (GSDMD)* was identified as a crucial executor of IL-18 release upon pyroptosis (*Nature*, 2016), as characterized by biochemical and structural studies.<br/>
**3. Downstream Signaling and Transcriptional Programs**<br/>
Upon receptor binding, IL-18 triggers key immune signaling pathways such as *NF-κB*, *STAT1*, and *STAT3*. These transcriptional programs mediate diverse cellular responses, including cytokine production, cell survival, and differentiation. Recent studies demonstrated that IL-18 exerts both pro-inflammatory and regulatory effects via context-dependent transcriptional mechanisms (*Nat Commun*, 2022; *Sci Adv*, 2024; *Nat Immunol*, 2025).<br/>
**4. Context-Dependent Mucosal Roles**<br/>
In mucosal immunity, IL-18 not only amplifies inflammatory signals but also contributes to *barrier maintenance and antimicrobial defense*. Studies have shown that IL-18 promotes *IL-22* production in specific innate lymphoid subsets (*Immunity*, 2014; *Nat Commun*, 2022). More recently, IL-18 was shown to influence *ILC fate plasticity*, reinforcing its role as a modulator of lineage decisions and effector programs (*Nat Commun*, 2024).<br/>
**5. Epithelial and Tissue-Specific Expression**<br/>
IL-18 is constitutively expressed in *intestinal epithelial cells* and regulated by *inflammasome sensors* such as NLRP6 (*Cell*, 2011/2014; *Science*, 2015). These studies revealed the essential role of epithelial IL-18 in orchestrating microbial tolerance and maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Further research extended its role to *neuroimmune circuits* and gut–brain axis regulation (*Cell*, 2020).<br/>
**6. Immune Tolerance and Regulatory Functions**<br/>
Beyond inflammation, IL-18 has been implicated in promoting *immune tolerance*, particularly in epithelial and myeloid contexts. Recent findings (*Immunity*, 2024) suggest that IL-18 helps balance tissue immunity by modulating both effector and regulatory networks during chronic stress and homeostasis.<br/>
**7. Tumor Immunology and Therapeutic Engineering**<br/>
In the tumor microenvironment, IL-18 can be neutralized by soluble decoy receptors, limiting its therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this, researchers developed *decoy-resistant IL-18 (drIL-18)*, which significantly enhanced antitumor responses in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (*Nature*, 2022; *Sci Adv*, 2024; *Nat Immunol*, 2025). These advances underscore IL-18’s potential in cancer immunotherapy.<br/><br/>

**Landmark Studies on IL-18: Mechanistic Insights and Immunological Roles Across Contexts**<br/>
<img src="/images/IL18_all/IL18_article.png"><br/><br/>



Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play a pivotal role in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis by orchestrating rapid and context-specific immune responses. Among ILC subsets, type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) and type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics, with ILC1s primarily involved in type 1 immune responses and ILC3s mediating type 3 immunity crucial for barrier defense and tissue repair.<br/><br/>

Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, is well established as a potent promoter of type 1 immunity. It enhances the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and activates ILC1s and other immune effectors, thus contributing to host defense against intracellular pathogens. Despite this canonical role, the influence of IL-18 on the balance and plasticity between ILC1 and ILC3 populations, particularly in the intestinal environment, remains incompletely understood.<br/><br/>

Recent studies using *Rorγt-fate mapping (Rorγt-FM)* and *Il18-deficient (Il18^-/-)* mouse models have revealed that in the small intestinal lamina propria (SILP), ILC3s are enriched relative to ILC1s, and notably, ILC3s express significantly higher levels of the IL-18 receptor alpha subunit (*IL18R1*). This differential expression pattern implies that IL-18 signaling may exert nuanced regulatory effects beyond its classical promotion of type 1 responses, potentially influencing ILC3 function and fate.<br/><br/>

Given the critical role of ILCs in gut immune homeostasis, it is essential to delineate how IL-18 modulates the balance between type 1 and type 3 immunity at mucosal surfaces. Understanding IL-18’s impact on ILC fate decisions will advance our knowledge of intestinal immune regulation and may reveal novel mechanisms underlying immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br/><br/>

## Results
### IL-18 Demonstrates Constitutively High Expression in Human Intestinal Tissues

Publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets reveal that IL-18 is constitutively and selectively enriched in human intestinal tissues.<br/>

Analysis of **The Human Protein Atlas** shows that *IL18* exhibits markedly elevated expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in the small intestine and colon compared to other organs. This expression pattern indicates that the intestinal tract is a major site of IL-18 production under homeostatic conditions.<br/>

Consistently, Bulk RNA-seq data from the **GSE165512** dataset demonstrate that *IL18* ranks as the highest-expressed interleukin in human gut tissues. Among all assessed cytokines, *IL18* displayed the greatest transcriptional abundance, further highlighting its predominant expression profile in the intestinal immune environment.<br/>

These findings collectively indicate that IL-18 is a gut-enriched cytokine with constitutively high expression, suggesting a fundamental role in maintaining intestinal immune physiology.<br/>

### Bulk RNA-seq and CosMx Spatial Transcriptomics Identify Elevated IL-18 Expression in Human IBD
Integrative analysis of bulk and spatial transcriptomic datasets demonstrates increased expression of IL-18 in the inflamed intestinal tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br/>

Spatial transcriptomics data from the GSE234713 CosMx platform indicate that *IL18* expression is elevated in both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) samples compared to non-diseased controls. The spatial distribution of *IL18* transcripts is enriched within the mucosal and submucosal regions, coinciding with areas of immune cell infiltration and epithelial disruption.<br/>

Complementary analysis of bulk RNA-seq data from the GSE137344 cohort, comprising 202 human intestinal samples, corroborates these findings by showing significantly higher *IL18* mRNA levels in inflamed tissues from CD and UC patients relative to healthy controls. The consistent upregulation of *IL18* across independent cohorts underscores its potential involvement in the inflammatory processes characteristic of IBD.<br/>

Collectively, these data establish *IL18* as a gene with increased transcriptional activity in the intestinal mucosa during active IBD, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis.<br/>

### Il18 Deficiency Does Not Exacerbate Colitis Severity in Acute DSS-Induced Inflammation
The impact of IL-18 deficiency on acute intestinal inflammation was evaluated using the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. Both *Il18^-/-* and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to DSS treatment, and disease severity was assessed by monitoring body weight changes and measuring colon length as indicators of inflammation and tissue damage.<br/>

No significant differences were observed between *Il18^-/-* and WT groups in either body weight loss or colon shortening during the acute phase of DSS-induced colitis. These findings suggest that IL-18 deficiency does not exacerbate clinical or morphological indicators of colitis severity under these experimental conditions.<br/>

However, the absence of detectable effects raises questions regarding the precise role of IL-18 in acute intestinal injury. It remains unclear whether IL-18 plays a redundant role in this model or if more chronic or alternative inflammatory contexts are required to reveal its functional significance. Further investigation employing additional disease models or extended time points may be necessary to fully elucidate IL-18’s contribution to intestinal inflammation.<br/>

**Comparable Colitis Severity Between Il18-Deficient and Wild-Type Mice in Acute DSS-Induced Inflammation**<br/>
<img src="/images/IL18_all/F3.png"><br/><br/>

### MERFISH Analysis Indicates a Slight Decrease in IL-18 Expression Following Acute DSS Treatment

Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) was employed to assess the temporal dynamics of *Il18* expression during acute colitis. Mice were subjected to DSS treatment and intestinal tissues were analyzed at multiple time points (Day 0, 3, 9, and 21) to capture both the acute and recovery phases of inflammation.<br/>

MERFISH data revealed a moderate but consistent reduction in *Il18* transcript levels following DSS administration. The downregulation was most prominent at Day 3 and Day 9, coinciding with peak inflammatory responses, and showed partial recovery by Day 21. These results suggest that *Il18* expression is dynamically regulated in response to acute mucosal injury, with transient suppression during active inflammation.<br/>

The modest decrease in *Il18* levels may reflect context-dependent regulation rather than a loss of function, and points to a potentially nuanced role for IL-18 in the early phases of epithelial injury and repair.

### Visium Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Temporal Stability and Delayed Upregulation of Il18 Expression During Colitis Resolution
Spatial transcriptomic profiling using the 10x Genomics Visium platform (dataset SCP2771) was conducted to assess *Il18* expression dynamics throughout the course of DSS-induced colitis. During the acute inflammatory phase, *Il18* levels remained relatively stable, with no marked decrease observed at early time points.<br/>

Strikingly, a progressive increase in *Il18* expression was detected during the recovery phase, with transcript levels rising notably by Day 30 and further by Day 73. This delayed upregulation suggests that *Il18* may participate in mucosal restoration and post-inflammatory immune regulation.<br/>

Given the recurrent nature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where periods of remission are punctuated by episodes of relapse, the sustained elevation of *Il18* during the resolution phase may represent a key molecular feature contributing to tissue priming or residual immune activation. These data implicate IL-18 not only in acute inflammatory responses but also in the maintenance of a post-inflammatory intestinal state that may influence susceptibility to subsequent flares.<br/>

### Single-Cell Analysis of Intestinal Immune Dynamics After Repeated DSS-Induced Injury

To capture the cellular and molecular dynamics underlying intestinal inflammation and repair, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on colonic tissues collected across multiple time points following repeated DSS-induced injury. The experimental timeline included both active colitic phases and post-inflammatory recovery (D0, D4, D7, D13, D21, D25, D28, and D34), enabling the characterization of dynamic changes in tissue composition over time.<br/>

Immune (CD45⁺) and non-immune (CD45⁻) compartments were enriched by flow cytometric sorting to ensure adequate representation of both inflammatory and stromal components. This approach allowed for high-resolution analysis of epithelial regeneration, immune cell activation states, and stromal-immune interactions across the disease course.<br/>

By integrating time-resolved single-cell data with injury and repair phases, this framework provides a comprehensive map of intestinal cell-state transitions and highlights potential regulators involved in inflammation resolution and relapse predisposition, key features relevant to chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br/>

### IL-18 Deficiency Ameliorates Secondary DSS-Induced Colitis
In a model of recurrent intestinal injury induced by repeated DSS administration, Il18-deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced disease severity relative to wild-type controls. This attenuation was demonstrated by diminished weight loss and maintenance of colon length during the secondary inflammatory challenge.<br/>

Interestingly, epithelial stress-associated genes *Psme3* (REGγ) and *Fut2* showed increased expression in the Il18 knockout group, suggesting that loss of IL-18 signaling triggers compensatory upregulation of epithelial defense mechanisms. The elevation of these markers may reflect adaptive responses that contribute to improved mucosal resilience and barrier function in the absence of IL-18.<br/>

These data collectively indicate that IL-18 facilitates inflammation-driven tissue damage during repeated colitis episodes, while its deficiency promotes epithelial adaptation and ameliorates disease progression, highlighting IL-18 as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.<br/>

### Integrative Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Predominant IL18R1 Expression in Intestinal Innate Lymphoid Cells
Analysis of a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing meta-dataset (scIBD, *Genome Biology*, 2023) comprising 1.14 million cells from 12 human intestinal datasets reveals that *IL18R1* expression is predominantly localized to innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), highlighting their central role as responders to IL-18 signaling within the intestinal immune landscape.

The integrative single-cell transcriptomic analysis leveraging the scIBD meta-dataset, encompassing over one million cells from twelve independent studies of human intestinal tissues, delineates the cellular distribution of *IL18* and its receptor *IL18R1* with unprecedented resolution. Notably, *IL18R1* expression is highly enriched in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), underscoring their prominent capacity to sense and respond to IL-18 within the intestinal microenvironment. This cell-type-specific receptor localization suggests that ILCs are key mediators of IL-18–driven immune modulation in gut homeostasis and inflammation. The spatial and quantitative insights from this large-scale integrative dataset provide a critical framework for understanding IL-18 signaling dynamics in the human intestine, with implications for inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis and therapy.

### Independent Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analyses Reveal Consistent Cell-Type-Specific Expression Patterns of IL18 and IL18R1 in the Intestine
Across all datasets, *Il18* expression was predominantly localized to intestinal epithelial and myeloid lineages, reflecting their central roles as innate cytokine sources in mucosal immunity. In contrast, *Il18r1* exhibited specific and consistent enrichment in group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), underscoring their capacity to sense IL-18 signaling cues. The reproducibility of these findings across species (human and mouse), tissue compartments (epithelial vs. immune), and platforms supports a conserved IL-18–IL18R1 axis that orchestrates communication between epithelial barriers and innate lymphoid effectors. This cell-type specificity provides critical insight into the spatial and functional architecture of IL-18 signaling in intestinal immune homeostasis.<br/><br/>

<img src="/images/IL18_all/F11.png"><br/><br/>


### MERFISH-Based Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Epithelial-Derived Il18 and Localized Il18r1 Expression in Intestinal ILC3s
High-resolution spatial transcriptomic profiling using MERFISH technology enabled precise mapping of *Il18* and *Il18r1* expression across intact intestinal tissue architecture. The analysis revealed that *Il18* is predominantly expressed by intestinal epithelial cells, aligning with their established role as a frontline source of cytokines that orchestrate mucosal immunity. In contrast, *Il18r1* was found to be selectively expressed by discrete populations of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which are spatially localized near the epithelial compartment.<br/>

This spatial co-localization supports a model in which epithelial-derived IL-18 signals directly to nearby ILC3s via IL18R1, reinforcing the concept of barrier-to-immune cell communication. These findings not only validate cell-type specificity observed in single-cell datasets but also provide spatial context critical for understanding IL-18–mediated immune regulation within the intestinal microenvironment.<br/>

### Flow Cytometry Confirms Preferential IL-18R1 Protein Expression in Intestinal ILC3s
Flow cytometric analysis was performed to validate IL-18 and IL-18R1 protein expression across major intestinal cell populations. Gating strategies included intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), lamina propria (LP) T cells, epithelial cells (IECs), and innate lymphoid cell subsets. The results revealed that IL-18R1 protein is robustly expressed by ILC3s, consistent with transcriptomic findings. In contrast, IL-18R1 was low or undetectable in IECs, and IELs and LP T cells exhibited significantly lower IL-18R1 expression compared to ILCs. These findings support a model in which ILC3s act as key IL-18–responsive populations in the gut, receiving cues from IL-18–producing epithelial or myeloid cells.<br/>

### Spatial Transcriptomics Identifies an Epithelial IL-18 to ILC3 IL-18R1 Signaling Axis
Spatial transcriptomic analysis delineates a cell–cell communication pathway in the intestinal microenvironment, whereby *Il18* expression is concentrated within epithelial cells and signals to *Il18r1*-expressing group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). This spatially resolved ligand–receptor pairing highlights a direct epithelial-to-immune cell crosstalk mechanism essential for mucosal immune regulation and intestinal homeostasis.<br/>

### Targeted Il18r1 Deletion in ILC3s Attenuates Recurrent Intestinal Inflammation
To functionally interrogate the role of IL-18 signaling in ILC3s during intestinal inflammation, mice with ILC3-specific deletion of *Il18r1* were subjected to a two-round DSS-induced colitis model. No significant differences in body weight loss were observed between knockout and control mice during the first acute phase. However, upon secondary DSS challenge, *Il18r1* deletion in ILC3s resulted in improved clinical outcomes, as evidenced by attenuated weight loss and a trend toward reduced inflammation. These findings indicate that IL-18 signaling in ILC3s contributes specifically to the exacerbation of inflammation during recurrent intestinal injury, and its disruption confers protection in chronic inflammatory settings.<br/>

<img src="/images/IL18_all/F17.png"><br/><br/>

### ILC3-Derived IL-22 Production Is Maintained in the Absence of IL-18 Signaling
Previous studies have suggested that IL-18 and IL-22 may engage in reciprocal regulatory loops, particularly under inflammatory conditions (*Immunity*, 2015). To directly assess whether IL-18 is required for IL-22 production in ILC3s, sorted small intestinal lamina propria (SiLP) ILC3s from WT and *Il18^-/-* mice were stimulated ex vivo with IL-23 (1 ng/mL) and IL-1β (0.5 ng/mL) for 3 hours. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that IL-22 production levels were comparable between WT and IL-18-deficient ILC3s. These findings indicate that IL-22 production by ILC3s is independent of IL-18 signaling in the context of acute cytokine stimulation, suggesting that IL-18 is dispensable for this effector function under homeostatic or early inflammatory conditions.<br/>

**IL-18 Deficiency Does Not Impair IL-22 Production by ILC3s**<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/IL18_all/F18.png"><br/><br/>


### IL-18 Selectively Regulates Plasticity of IL-22 Fate-Mapping Negative ILC3s
To delineate the role of IL-18 in regulating ILC3 plasticity, IL-22 fate-mapping (IL-22^FM) mice were employed to track the lineage history of IL-22-producing cells. Comparative analysis revealed that IL-18 deficiency predominantly affected the frequency and phenotype of IL-22^FM⁻ ILC3s, suggesting that IL-18 exerts its regulatory function on ILC3s that have not previously expressed IL-22. In contrast, IL-22^FM⁺ ILC3s displayed stable identities and showed limited evidence of transdifferentiation into ILC1-like cells, even in the absence of IL-18 signaling.

Further, adoptive transfer experiments were conducted using IL-22^FM⁺ ILC3s and wild-type bone marrow into GATA3^fl/fl Vav-Cre recipient mice (which lack endogenous ILCs). The transferred IL-22^FM⁺ ILC3s failed to give rise to ILC1s, as indicated by the lack of fate-mapped ILC1s in the gut, despite the presence of RORγt lineage labeling. These findings indicate that IL-18 promotes type 1 conversion specifically from IL-22^FM⁻ ILC3s, while IL-22^FM⁺ ILC3s represent a committed, non-plastic subset.

### IL-18 Deficiency Skews Intestinal ILC Subset Composition
To evaluate the impact of IL-18 signaling on the composition of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the gut, flow cytometric profiling was performed in *Il18^-/-* mice. Analysis of small intestinal lamina propria (SiLP) and colonic lamina propria (cLP) revealed a marked reduction in NKp46⁺ ILC3s, particularly within the SiLP. Concurrently, a decrease in the frequency of ILC1s was observed in the cLP compartment. These alterations suggest that IL-18 signaling is required to maintain the proper balance of group 1 and group 3 ILC subsets in the intestinal mucosa, potentially by promoting the stability or differentiation of specific lineages.<br/>

**IL-18 Deficiency Reduces NKp46⁺ ILC3s and ILC1s in the Gut**
<img src="/images/IL18_all/F21.png"><br/><br/>


### IL-18 Drives CCR6⁻ ILC3 Transdifferentiation Toward ILC1s via Fate-Mapping and In Vitro Reprogramming
To specifically examine the plasticity of CCR6⁻ ILC3s under IL-18 regulation, *Rorc^FM* fate-mapping mice were utilized to trace the conversion of ILC3s into ILC1s. In *Il18^-/-* mice, the frequency of RORγt fate-mapping positive (FM⁺) ILC1s was significantly reduced, suggesting impaired lineage conversion from ILC3s in the absence of IL-18 signaling.

Further validation was conducted using sorted CCR6⁻ ILC3s cultured in vitro with OP9 stromal cells and cytokines (IL-7 + IL-2). After 5 days, the addition of IL-18, particularly in combination with IL-12, significantly enhanced the emergence of ILC1-like cells. Notably, stimulation with IL-1β or IL-23 failed to elicit a comparable increase in ILC1s. These results underscore IL-18’s critical role in licensing the transdifferentiation of CCR6⁻ ILC3s into ILC1s, likely by reinforcing type 1 transcriptional programs.

### IL-18R1 Expression Is Coupled to NKp46 Acquisition During ILC3-to-ILC1 Lineage Transition
The upregulation of IL-18R1 marks a critical molecular transition during the plasticity of ILC3s toward an ILC1 phenotype. Analysis of bulk ATAC-seq data (GSE116093) derived from sorted intestinal innate lymphoid cell subsets—including NK cells, ILC1s, ex-ILC3s, CCR6⁻ ILC3s, and CCR6⁺ ILC3s—revealed progressively increased chromatin accessibility at the *Il18r1* locus in line with the acquisition of type 1 characteristics. Accessibility was lowest in CCR6⁺ ILC3s, intermediate in CCR6⁻ ILC3s and ex-ILC3s, and highest in mature ILC1s and NK cells, suggesting a gradual licensing of IL-18 responsiveness during lineage conversion.<br/>

Flow cytometry further confirmed this pattern at the protein level: IL-18R1 expression was lowest in NKp46⁻ ILC3s, moderately expressed in NKp46^int ILC3s, and significantly upregulated in NKp46⁺ ILC3s. Moreover, ex-ILC3s (as determined by RORγt fate-mapping) consistently exhibited higher IL-18R1 levels than steady-state ILC1s. These findings indicate that IL-18 signaling is preferentially activated during transitional stages and may function as a reinforcing cue in the progression from ILC3s to ILC1s.<br/>

### Pseudotime Analysis Identifies IL-18R1 as a Transitional Marker in ILC3-to-ILC1 Plasticity During Colitis Progression
Single-cell pseudotime analysis of intestinal innate lymphoid cells during DSS-induced colitis reveals a transitional trajectory from CCR6⁻ ILC3s toward ILC1s, characterized by dynamic changes in *Il18r1* expression. At steady state, *Il18r1* is highly expressed in ILC3s but markedly lower in mature ILC1s. During the progression of inflammation, particularly in the second round of DSS treatment (R2D0 to R2D7), *Il18r1* expression increases along the pseudotime trajectory, peaking at intermediate transdifferentiation states, before declining as cells adopt an ILC1-like identity.<br/>

This expression pattern suggests that IL-18R1 marks an intermediate state of ILC plasticity and may actively contribute to the fate transition under inflammatory conditions. The transient upregulation of *Il18r1* during ILC3-to-ILC1 conversion underscores the temporal specificity of IL-18 signaling in shaping the intestinal immune landscape.<br/>

### IL-18 Deficiency Modulates ILC-Related Transcriptional Programs in Skin: Implications for Gut ILC Plasticity
Combined bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of skin-resident ILCs from *Il18^-/-* and wild-type mice uncover significant alterations in transcription factors associated with ILC subset specification and functional plasticity. Notably, *STAT1*, *STAT3*, and *NF-κB* pathway components—key regulators in the transition from ILC3 to ILC1 phenotypes—exhibit dysregulated expression in the absence of IL-18. These data suggest that IL-18 signaling contributes to maintaining the transcriptional equilibrium necessary for ILC stability and fate decisions.<br/>

Given the shared transcriptional architecture between skin and intestinal ILCs, these findings serve as a prelude to targeted manipulation of these transcriptional regulators in the gut. Future studies will investigate how perturbation of *Stat1*, *Stat3*, and *Nfkb1* influences ILC3-to-ILC1 conversion within the inflamed intestinal environment.<br/>

### scATAC-seq Reveals IL-18BP-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation in Intestinal Immune Cells
Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-seq) was performed on intestinal immune cells isolated from *Il18bp^-/-* and wild-type mice to delineate transcriptional regulators impacted by the absence of IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a natural inhibitor of IL-18 signaling. The analysis revealed significant alterations in the chromatin accessibility of loci encoding transcription factors critical for ILC identity and plasticity, including *Stat1*, *Stat3*, and members of the NF-κB family.<br/>

These findings highlight the role of IL-18BP in modulating the transcriptional landscape of intestinal immune populations, particularly those involved in the ILC3-to-ILC1 transition. Disruption of IL-18BP results in a permissive chromatin state favoring pro-inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that IL-18/IL-18BP signaling axis plays a vital role in shaping ILC fate and function during intestinal inflammation.<br/>

### STAT3 Is Dispensable for IL-18R1 Expression in NCR⁺ ILC3s
To evaluate whether STAT3 signaling regulates IL-18R1 expression in group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), *Stat3^fl/fl* mice were crossed with *Ncr1-Cre* to generate NCR⁺ ILC-specific STAT3-deficient mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the expression of IL-18R1 in NCR⁺ ILC3s from *Ncr1-Cre Stat3^fl/fl* mice was comparable to wild-type controls. These findings suggest that STAT3 is not required for the maintenance of IL-18R1 expression in this subset of ILC3s, indicating that other transcriptional regulators may mediate IL-18R1 expression in the context of NCR⁺ ILC biology.<br/>

**Overview:**  
This study investigates the multifaceted role of interleukin-18 (IL-18) in intestinal immunity, with a particular focus on its expression dynamics, clinical relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and functional implications in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).  

**Key Findings:**  
- **Constitutive and Disease-Associated Expression:** IL-18 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract under homeostatic conditions, with spatial and bulk RNA-seq datasets indicating further elevation in IBD, reinforcing its clinical relevance.
- **Acute Inflammation Response:** In a single-cycle dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model, IL-18 deficiency did not exacerbate disease severity (e.g., body weight loss, colon shortening), suggesting that IL-18 may not be critical in early-stage colitis.
- **Chronic and Recurrent Inflammation:** Spatial transcriptomic and bulk analyses in chronic DSS models revealed sustained or elevated IL-18 expression during the recovery phase, implicating IL-18 in chronic or relapsing intestinal inflammation.
- **Secondary Colitis and Immunoregulation:** In contrast to the acute model, IL-18 deficiency conferred significant protection in secondary DSS-induced colitis, indicating a context-dependent regulatory role of IL-18 in chronic inflammation.
- **Role in ILC Biology:** IL-18 shapes the phenotypic composition of ILC subsets, particularly by influencing the balance between NKp46⁺ ILC3s and ILC1s. IL-18 signaling promotes ILC3-to-ILC1 transdifferentiation, without affecting IL-22 production or RORγt fate-mapping.
- **Mechanistic Insights:** Initial observations suggest that the IL-18–IL-18R1 axis preferentially targets IL-22 fate-mapping negative (FM⁻) ILC3s. Preliminary analyses indicate that STAT3 may not regulate IL-18R1 expression in NCR⁺ ILC3s, highlighting the need for further mechanistic studies.

**Future Directions:**  
- **ILC Profiling in Gut Inflammation:** FACS-purified ILCs from IL-18 knockout models of intestinal inflammation have been collected and are currently awaiting single-cell RNA sequencing to delineate IL-18-dependent transcriptional programs.
- **Fate-Mapping and Plasticity Analyses:** Ongoing single-cell fate-mapping studies (e.g., RORγt-FM) aim to elucidate the cellular trajectories and plasticity of ILC subsets in the inflamed gut microenvironment.
- **Cytokine Response Characterization:** Functional experiments evaluating the response of intestinal ILCs to exogenous IL-18 treatment are underway.
- **Transcriptional Regulation:** Identification and validation of transcription factors that govern IL-18-mediated ILC3-to-ILC1 transdifferentiation remain a high priority, with candidates being screened via scATAC-seq and knockout strategies.

This work advances the understanding of IL-18 as a critical cytokine in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation, with potential implications for IBD pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting.
