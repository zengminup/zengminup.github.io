## Scientific Question  
<br/>
**How Does IL-18 Regulate Intestinal Homeostasis?**<br/><br/>


## Background
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), represents a group of chronic, relapsing-remitting inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is characterized by aberrant mucosal immune responses to commensal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to sustained intestinal inflammation, epithelial barrier disruption, and progressive tissue damage. Clinically, CD can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract with transmural inflammation and granuloma formation, while UC is typically confined to the colon and limited to mucosal layers.<br/><br/>
Over the past several decades, the global incidence and prevalence of IBD have markedly increased, particularly in newly industrialized countries, signifying the role of environmental and lifestyle factors in disease pathogenesis. According to epidemiological estimates, more than 6 million individuals worldwide are affected by IBD, imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems due to its chronic course, need for lifelong therapy, and frequent complications such as fibrosis, strictures, and colorectal cancer.<br/><br/>
**IBD Epidemiology**<br/><img src="/images/IL18_all/Epidemiology.png"><br/>

Advances in high-throughput technologies, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics, and proteomics, have significantly enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IBD pathogenesis. GWAS have identified over 200 susceptibility loci associated with IBD, many of which converge on immune regulatory pathways, including cytokine signaling, innate immune activation, and epithelial barrier integrity. Among the cytokines highlighted by these integrative analyses, interleukin-18 (IL-18), a member of the IL-1 family, has emerged as a critical player.<br/><br/>

IL-18 is constitutively expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and is rapidly processed into its active form upon inflammasome activation, particularly via NLRP3 and caspase-1. Functional multi-omics approaches have revealed upregulation of IL-18 in inflamed intestinal tissues of IBD patients, with proteomic data corroborating its increased secretion in both mucosal biopsies and serum samples. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomic studies have demonstrated compartmentalized expression of IL-18 within the intestinal epithelium, suggesting a tissue-intrinsic role in epithelial-immune cell crosstalk.<br/><br/>

Collectively, these findings implicate IL-18 as a key mediator in the interface between epithelial stress responses and immune activation in the gut, highlighting the need to delineate its context-dependent roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis versus promoting inflammation.<br/><br/>

The cytokine **interleukin-18 (IL-18)** has emerged as a key immunoregulatory molecule with diverse functions spanning host defense, epithelial integrity, tumor immunity, and immune tolerance. A series of landmark studies have collectively shaped our current understanding of IL-18 biology.

**1. Discovery and Functional Identity**<br/>
IL-18 was originally described as *interferon-γ–inducing factor (IGIF)* in a foundational study published in *Nature* (1995), which identified its role in promoting *Th1 responses*. Follow-up studies demonstrated the synergistic effect of *IL-12 and IL-18* in driving IFN-γ production (*J Immunol*, 1998), establishing IL-18 as a central bridge between innate and adaptive immunity.<br/>
**2. Upstream Activation Mechanisms**<br/>
The secretion of bioactive IL-18 requires proteolytic cleavage of its precursor form by *inflammasome-activated caspases*. *Caspase-1*–dependent processing was elucidated in early studies (*Nature*, 2017), while later work revealed *caspase-4* as a non-canonical IL-18 activator (*Nature*, 2023). *Gasdermin D (GSDMD)* was identified as a crucial executor of IL-18 release upon pyroptosis (*Nature*, 2016), as characterized by biochemical and structural studies.<br/>
**3. Downstream Signaling and Transcriptional Programs**<br/>
Upon receptor binding, IL-18 triggers key immune signaling pathways such as *NF-κB*, *STAT1*, and *STAT3*. These transcriptional programs mediate diverse cellular responses, including cytokine production, cell survival, and differentiation. Recent studies demonstrated that IL-18 exerts both pro-inflammatory and regulatory effects via context-dependent transcriptional mechanisms (*Nat Commun*, 2022; *Sci Adv*, 2024; *Nat Immunol*, 2025).<br/>
**4. Context-Dependent Mucosal Roles**<br/>
In mucosal immunity, IL-18 not only amplifies inflammatory signals but also contributes to *barrier maintenance and antimicrobial defense*. Studies have shown that IL-18 promotes *IL-22* production in specific innate lymphoid subsets (*Immunity*, 2014; *Nat Commun*, 2022). More recently, IL-18 was shown to influence *ILC fate plasticity*, reinforcing its role as a modulator of lineage decisions and effector programs (*Nat Commun*, 2024).<br/>
**5. Epithelial and Tissue-Specific Expression**<br/>
IL-18 is constitutively expressed in *intestinal epithelial cells* and regulated by *inflammasome sensors* such as NLRP6 (*Cell*, 2011/2014; *Science*, 2015). These studies revealed the essential role of epithelial IL-18 in orchestrating microbial tolerance and maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Further research extended its role to *neuroimmune circuits* and gut–brain axis regulation (*Cell*, 2020).<br/>
**6. Immune Tolerance and Regulatory Functions**<br/>
Beyond inflammation, IL-18 has been implicated in promoting *immune tolerance*, particularly in epithelial and myeloid contexts. Recent findings (*Immunity*, 2024) suggest that IL-18 helps balance tissue immunity by modulating both effector and regulatory networks during chronic stress and homeostasis.<br/>
**7. Tumor Immunology and Therapeutic Engineering**<br/>
In the tumor microenvironment, IL-18 can be neutralized by soluble decoy receptors, limiting its therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this, researchers developed *decoy-resistant IL-18 (drIL-18)*, which significantly enhanced antitumor responses in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (*Nature*, 2022; *Sci Adv*, 2024; *Nat Immunol*, 2025). These advances underscore IL-18’s potential in cancer immunotherapy.<br/><br/>

**Landmark Studies on IL-18: Mechanistic Insights and Immunological Roles Across Contexts**<br/>

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play a pivotal role in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis by orchestrating rapid and context-specific immune responses. Among ILC subsets, type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) and type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) exhibit distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics, with ILC1s primarily involved in type 1 immune responses and ILC3s mediating type 3 immunity crucial for barrier defense and tissue repair.<br/><br/>

Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, is well established as a potent promoter of type 1 immunity. It enhances the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and activates ILC1s and other immune effectors, thus contributing to host defense against intracellular pathogens. Despite this canonical role, the influence of IL-18 on the balance and plasticity between ILC1 and ILC3 populations, particularly in the intestinal environment, remains incompletely understood.<br/><br/>

Recent studies using *Rorγt-fate mapping (Rorγt-FM)* and *Il18-deficient (Il18^-/-)* mouse models have revealed that in the small intestinal lamina propria (SILP), ILC3s are enriched relative to ILC1s, and notably, ILC3s express significantly higher levels of the IL-18 receptor alpha subunit (*IL18R1*). This differential expression pattern implies that IL-18 signaling may exert nuanced regulatory effects beyond its classical promotion of type 1 responses, potentially influencing ILC3 function and fate.<br/><br/>

Given the critical role of ILCs in gut immune homeostasis, it is essential to delineate how IL-18 modulates the balance between type 1 and type 3 immunity at mucosal surfaces. Understanding IL-18’s impact on ILC fate decisions will advance our knowledge of intestinal immune regulation and may reveal novel mechanisms underlying immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br/><br/>

## Results
### IL-18 Demonstrates Constitutively High Expression in Human Intestinal Tissues

Publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets reveal that IL-18 is constitutively and selectively enriched in human intestinal tissues.<br/>

Analysis of **The Human Protein Atlas** shows that *IL18* exhibits markedly elevated expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in the small intestine and colon compared to other organs. This expression pattern indicates that the intestinal tract is a major site of IL-18 production under homeostatic conditions.<br/>

Consistently, Bulk RNA-seq data from the **GSE165512** dataset demonstrate that *IL18* ranks as the highest-expressed interleukin in human gut tissues. Among all assessed cytokines, *IL18* displayed the greatest transcriptional abundance, further highlighting its predominant expression profile in the intestinal immune environment.<br/>

These findings collectively indicate that IL-18 is a gut-enriched cytokine with constitutively high expression, suggesting a fundamental role in maintaining intestinal immune physiology.<br/>

### Bulk RNA-seq and CosMx Spatial Transcriptomics Identify Elevated IL-18 Expression in Human IBD
Integrative analysis of bulk and spatial transcriptomic datasets demonstrates increased expression of IL-18 in the inflamed intestinal tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br/>

Spatial transcriptomics data from the GSE234713 CosMx platform indicate that *IL18* expression is elevated in both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) samples compared to non-diseased controls. The spatial distribution of *IL18* transcripts is enriched within the mucosal and submucosal regions, coinciding with areas of immune cell infiltration and epithelial disruption.<br/>

Complementary analysis of bulk RNA-seq data from the GSE137344 cohort, comprising 202 human intestinal samples, corroborates these findings by showing significantly higher *IL18* mRNA levels in inflamed tissues from CD and UC patients relative to healthy controls. The consistent upregulation of *IL18* across independent cohorts underscores its potential involvement in the inflammatory processes characteristic of IBD.<br/>

Collectively, these data establish *IL18* as a gene with increased transcriptional activity in the intestinal mucosa during active IBD, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis.<br/>

### Il18 Deficiency Does Not Exacerbate Colitis Severity in Acute DSS-Induced Inflammation
The impact of IL-18 deficiency on acute intestinal inflammation was evaluated using the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. Both *Il18^-/-* and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to DSS treatment, and disease severity was assessed by monitoring body weight changes and measuring colon length as indicators of inflammation and tissue damage.<br/>

No significant differences were observed between *Il18^-/-* and WT groups in either body weight loss or colon shortening during the acute phase of DSS-induced colitis. These findings suggest that IL-18 deficiency does not exacerbate clinical or morphological indicators of colitis severity under these experimental conditions.<br/>

However, the absence of detectable effects raises questions regarding the precise role of IL-18 in acute intestinal injury. It remains unclear whether IL-18 plays a redundant role in this model or if more chronic or alternative inflammatory contexts are required to reveal its functional significance. Further investigation employing additional disease models or extended time points may be necessary to fully elucidate IL-18’s contribution to intestinal inflammation.<br/>

### MERFISH Analysis Indicates a Slight Decrease in IL-18 Expression Following Acute DSS Treatment

Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) was employed to assess the temporal dynamics of *Il18* expression during acute colitis. Mice were subjected to DSS treatment and intestinal tissues were analyzed at multiple time points (Day 0, 3, 9, and 21) to capture both the acute and recovery phases of inflammation.<br/>

MERFISH data revealed a moderate but consistent reduction in *Il18* transcript levels following DSS administration. The downregulation was most prominent at Day 3 and Day 9, coinciding with peak inflammatory responses, and showed partial recovery by Day 21. These results suggest that *Il18* expression is dynamically regulated in response to acute mucosal injury, with transient suppression during active inflammation.<br/>

The modest decrease in *Il18* levels may reflect context-dependent regulation rather than a loss of function, and points to a potentially nuanced role for IL-18 in the early phases of epithelial injury and repair.

### Visium Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Temporal Stability and Delayed Upregulation of Il18 Expression During Colitis Resolution
Spatial transcriptomic profiling using the 10x Genomics Visium platform (dataset SCP2771) was conducted to assess *Il18* expression dynamics throughout the course of DSS-induced colitis. During the acute inflammatory phase, *Il18* levels remained relatively stable, with no marked decrease observed at early time points.<br/>

Strikingly, a progressive increase in *Il18* expression was detected during the recovery phase, with transcript levels rising notably by Day 30 and further by Day 73. This delayed upregulation suggests that *Il18* may participate in mucosal restoration and post-inflammatory immune regulation.<br/>

Given the recurrent nature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where periods of remission are punctuated by episodes of relapse, the sustained elevation of *Il18* during the resolution phase may represent a key molecular feature contributing to tissue priming or residual immune activation. These data implicate IL-18 not only in acute inflammatory responses but also in the maintenance of a post-inflammatory intestinal state that may influence susceptibility to subsequent flares.<br/>

### Single-Cell Analysis of Intestinal Immune Dynamics After Repeated DSS-Induced Injury

To capture the cellular and molecular dynamics underlying intestinal inflammation and repair, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on colonic tissues collected across multiple time points following repeated DSS-induced injury. The experimental timeline included both active colitic phases and post-inflammatory recovery (D0, D4, D7, D13, D21, D25, D28, and D34), enabling the characterization of dynamic changes in tissue composition over time.<br/>

Immune (CD45⁺) and non-immune (CD45⁻) compartments were enriched by flow cytometric sorting to ensure adequate representation of both inflammatory and stromal components. This approach allowed for high-resolution analysis of epithelial regeneration, immune cell activation states, and stromal-immune interactions across the disease course.<br/>

By integrating time-resolved single-cell data with injury and repair phases, this framework provides a comprehensive map of intestinal cell-state transitions and highlights potential regulators involved in inflammation resolution and relapse predisposition, key features relevant to chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<br/>

### IL-18 Deficiency Ameliorates Secondary DSS-Induced Colitis
In a model of recurrent intestinal injury induced by repeated DSS administration, Il18-deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced disease severity relative to wild-type controls. This attenuation was demonstrated by diminished weight loss and maintenance of colon length during the secondary inflammatory challenge.<br/>

Interestingly, epithelial stress-associated genes *Psme3* (REGγ) and *Fut2* showed increased expression in the Il18 knockout group, suggesting that loss of IL-18 signaling triggers compensatory upregulation of epithelial defense mechanisms. The elevation of these markers may reflect adaptive responses that contribute to improved mucosal resilience and barrier function in the absence of IL-18.<br/>

These data collectively indicate that IL-18 facilitates inflammation-driven tissue damage during repeated colitis episodes, while its deficiency promotes epithelial adaptation and ameliorates disease progression, highlighting IL-18 as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.<br/>

### Integrative Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Predominant IL18R1 Expression in Intestinal Innate Lymphoid Cells
Analysis of a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing meta-dataset (scIBD, *Genome Biology*, 2023) comprising 1.14 million cells from 12 human intestinal datasets reveals that *IL18R1* expression is predominantly localized to innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), highlighting their central role as responders to IL-18 signaling within the intestinal immune landscape.

The integrative single-cell transcriptomic analysis leveraging the scIBD meta-dataset, encompassing over one million cells from twelve independent studies of human intestinal tissues, delineates the cellular distribution of *IL18* and its receptor *IL18R1* with unprecedented resolution. Notably, *IL18R1* expression is highly enriched in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), underscoring their prominent capacity to sense and respond to IL-18 within the intestinal microenvironment. This cell-type-specific receptor localization suggests that ILCs are key mediators of IL-18–driven immune modulation in gut homeostasis and inflammation. The spatial and quantitative insights from this large-scale integrative dataset provide a critical framework for understanding IL-18 signaling dynamics in the human intestine, with implications for inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis and therapy.
