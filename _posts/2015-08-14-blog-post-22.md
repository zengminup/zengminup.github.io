Background
======
# Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by aberrant immune activation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and sustained tissue damage. While the precise etiology remains incompletely elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that IBD arises from a complex interplay among host genetic susceptibility, dysregulated mucosal immune responses, alterations in the gut microbiota, and environmental factors. These pathogenic interactions culminate in persistent intestinal inflammation and progressive structural remodeling, ultimately contributing to disease chronicity and relapse.

## Investigation of IBD Pathogenesis Using Murine Models

To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IBD pathogenesis, various murine models have been developed, among which the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model is widely utilized due to its ability to recapitulate key pathological hallmarks of UC. DSS administration disrupts the intestinal epithelial barrier, leading to microbial translocation, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine-mediated inflammation, thereby modeling both acute colitis and subsequent tissue repair processes. However, the precise dynamics of immune and non-immune cell populations during disease onset, progression, and resolution remain incompletely understood.

## Objective of the Study

In this study, we employed a two-cycle DSS-induced colitis model to systematically characterize the temporal evolution of colonic cellular compartments during disease initiation, inflammation, and recovery. By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we aimed to comprehensively delineate the transcriptional landscape of colonic epithelial and lamina propria immune cells at multiple disease stages. This approach enables the high-resolution mapping of cellular heterogeneity, immune activation states, and dynamic shifts in transcriptional programs that orchestrate inflammatory responses and tissue remodeling in colitis.

# Intestinal Endothelial Cells and Their Role in Inflammatory Bowel Disease

The intestinal vasculature is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis by regulating nutrient and oxygen exchange, immune cell trafficking, and inflammatory responses. Lining the blood and lymphatic vessels of the intestine, intestinal endothelial cells (IECs) form a selectively permeable barrier that controls the bidirectional movement of immune cells, metabolites, and inflammatory mediators between the circulation and the gut microenvironment. These cells also interact dynamically with epithelial and immune cells to maintain mucosal integrity.

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), the intestinal endothelium undergoes profound functional and structural alterations that contribute to chronic inflammation. A key pathological feature of IBD is endothelial activation and dysfunction, which leads to increased vascular permeability, aberrant leukocyte recruitment, and excessive angiogenesis.

## 1. Endothelial Dysfunction and Increased Vascular Permeability

Under homeostatic conditions, intestinal endothelial cells maintain vascular integrity through tight junctions, adherens junctions, and the glycocalyx layer, which prevent excessive plasma leakage and immune cell infiltration. However, in IBD, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) disrupt endothelial junctions, increasing vascular permeability and facilitating the extravasation of immune cells into inflamed tissue. This endothelial barrier breakdown exacerbates tissue edema and amplifies mucosal damage.

## 2. Dysregulated Leukocyte Trafficking and Adhesion Molecule Expression

Endothelial cells play a crucial role in regulating leukocyte trafficking by expressing adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1). These molecules mediate the recruitment of circulating immune cells to sites of inflammation. In IBD, increased expression of MAdCAM-1, particularly in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), promotes excessive homing of α4β7 integrin-expressing T cells, leading to sustained inflammation. Therapies targeting α4β7 integrin-MAdCAM-1 interactions (e.g., vedolizumab) have been developed to selectively block gut-specific leukocyte trafficking.

## 3. Pathological Angiogenesis in IBD

In response to chronic inflammation, intestinal endothelial cells undergo pathological angiogenesis, a process characterized by the excessive formation of dysfunctional blood vessels. This is driven by the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other pro-angiogenic factors. Unlike physiological angiogenesis, which supports tissue repair, IBD-associated angiogenesis results in leaky, disorganized, and pro-inflammatory vasculature, perpetuating immune cell infiltration and exacerbating disease severity. Elevated VEGF levels in the intestinal mucosa correlate with increased disease activity in both UC and CD, making anti-angiogenic therapies a potential strategy for IBD treatment.

## 4. Endothelial Cells as Immunomodulators

Beyond serving as passive conduits for blood flow, endothelial cells actively participate in immune regulation. IECs can present antigens via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, secrete pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and influence the behavior of innate and adaptive immune cells. Dysregulated endothelial signaling in IBD sustains chronic inflammation by fostering a pro-thrombotic state (via increased platelet aggregation and coagulation factors) and by promoting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), which contributes to fibrosis and stricture formation in Crohn’s disease.

# Conclusion

The intestinal endothelium is a critical but often underappreciated component of IBD pathogenesis. Endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular permeability, aberrant immune cell trafficking, and pathological angiogenesis collectively contribute to disease progression.

Method
======
# **Materials and Methods**

## **DSS-Induced Colitis Model**

C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a two-cycle DSS treatment regimen to induce colitis. The first DSS administration (2.5% DSS in drinking water) was provided from day 0 (D0) to day 6 (D6) to induce an initial inflammatory response. After a recovery period, a second round of DSS exposure (3% DSS, D21-D27) was applied to simulate recurrent colitis episodes, which more closely resemble the relapsing nature of human ulcerative colitis (UC). Disease severity was monitored through body weight measurements, stool consistency, and the presence of occult or overt rectal bleeding.

---

## **Tissue Dissociation and Single-Cell Isolation**

### **Colon Tissue Processing**

At each designated time point, mice were euthanized via CO₂ asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. The entire colon was harvested, flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and longitudinally opened. Mucosal tissue was visually examined for ulceration, hyperemia, and inflammatory infiltrates before proceeding with cellular dissociation.

---

### **Fractionation of Colonic Cellular Compartments**

To ensure a comprehensive assessment of both epithelial and immune cell populations, colonic tissues were enzymatically and chemically dissociated into two fractions:

#### **1. Epithelial Cell Isolation**

Colonic epithelial cells were dissociated using a chelation-based protocol optimized to preserve epithelial integrity:
- Tissue was incubated in pre-warmed **5 mM EDTA** and **1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)** in **Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺-free HBSS** at **37°C for 30 min** with gentle agitation.
- Dislodged epithelial cells were collected, passed through a **70-μm cell strainer**, and pelleted by centrifugation at **300 × g for 5 min at 4°C**.
- Cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with **0.04% BSA** for further processing.

#### **2. Lamina Propria Immune Cell Isolation**

The remaining tissue fraction, containing immune and stromal cells, was subjected to enzymatic digestion:
- Tissues were minced and incubated in **RPMI-1640** containing **1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (Worthington)**, **0.5 mg/mL DNase I (Roche)**, and **5% FBS** at **37°C for 45 min** with intermittent vortexing.
- The digestion was quenched with **ice-cold PBS supplemented with 10% FBS**, and the cell suspension was passed through a **40-μm filter** to remove undigested fragments.
- Immune cells were enriched via **40%/80% Percoll gradient centrifugation (800 × g, 20 min, no brake)**.

---

## **Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and Pooling Strategy**

To enable a comprehensive transcriptional analysis of colonic immune and non-immune populations, single-cell suspensions were labeled with viability dyes and surface markers:

- **Immune cells:** **CD45+** (immune lineage marker)
- **Non-immune cells:** **CD45− EpCAM+** (epithelial cells), **CD45− PDGFRα+** (fibroblasts), **CD45− CD31+** (endothelial cells)

Sorted fractions were pooled and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

---

## **Single-Cell RNA Sequencing and Data Processing**

### **Library Preparation and Sequencing**

Sorted single-cell suspensions were processed using the **10x Genomics Chromium platform** with the **3’ v3.1 single-cell gene expression kit** following the manufacturer’s protocol. Barcoded single-cell cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced on an **Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform** to achieve a minimum sequencing depth of **50,000 reads per cell**.

### **Raw Data Processing and Preprocessing**

Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed and aligned to the **mm10 (GRCm38) mouse reference genome** using **Cell Ranger (v6.1.2, 10x Genomics)**. The resulting unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrices were processed in **Scanpy (v1.9.3)**.
