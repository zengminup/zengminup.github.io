Background
======
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and progressive remodeling of intestinal tissue. While extensive research has focused on the role of immune cells in driving inflammation, the contribution of stromal cells—particularly fibroblasts—has gained increasing attention. Fibroblasts not only maintain extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis but also modulate immune responses, making them key players in tissue remodeling and disease progression. However, their functional heterogeneity, spatial organization, and interactions with other cell types in the inflamed gut remain incompletely understood.

Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics provide an opportunity to dissect these spatially coordinated processes at single-cell resolution. One such study employed multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to profile 1.35 million cells across different stages of DSS-induced colitis in mice. This dataset includes both healthy and inflamed intestinal tissues, covering multiple time points from disease onset to recovery. The samples span various conditions: healthy controls (D0), early inflammation (D3), peak inflammation (D9), and post-recovery (D21). Technical replicates and spatial coordinates enable detailed mapping of fibroblast populations and their inflammatory transitions. Cell-type annotations include major immune and stromal lineages, allowing for the identification of inflammation-associated fibroblasts (IAFs) and their interactions with immune cells within spatially defined tissue neighborhoods.

Leveraging this publicly available dataset, I aim to explore fibroblast heterogeneity and their role in gut inflammation. Specifically, by analyzing transcriptional states, spatial localization, and cellular interactions, I seek to gain insights into (1) the differentiation trajectories of fibroblasts in response to inflammation, (2) their contribution to ECM remodeling and immune modulation, and (3) the parallels between murine and human IBD pathology. Through this analysis, I aim to refine our understanding of fibroblast-mediated disease mechanisms and provide a spatially resolved framework for investigating stromal-immune crosstalk in colitis.
