Background
======
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance anti-tumor immunity. The MC38 murine colorectal adenocarcinoma model has been extensively utilized in preclinical studies to investigate tumor immunology and the efficacy of immunotherapeutic interventions. A defining feature of solid tumors, including MC38, is the presence of a complex and dynamic tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which is largely composed of infiltrating CD45 immune cells. These leukocytes encompass a diverse spectrum of immune subsets, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and various T and B lymphocyte populations, each contributing to either pro- or anti-tumor immune responses. The functional heterogeneity of these immune populations plays a crucial role in determining tumor progression, immune evasion, and response to immunotherapy.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative technology for dissecting the transcriptomic heterogeneity of immune cells at single-cell resolution. Unlike bulk RNA sequencing, which masks cellular heterogeneity by averaging gene expression across populations, scRNA-seq enables the identification of distinct cellular states, rare immune subsets, and transcriptional programs driving immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment. By applying scRNA-seq to CD45 immune cells isolated from MC38 tumors, researchers can characterize the composition, phenotypic states, and functional dynamics of tumor-infiltrating immune populations. This high-resolution approach facilitates the identification of novel immunoregulatory mechanisms, lineage plasticity, and potential therapeutic targets that could be exploited to modulate anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, comparative scRNA-seq analyses across different treatment conditions, such as immune checkpoint blockade or myeloid-targeting therapies, can provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic changes in immune cell populations that underpin therapeutic responses and resistance mechanisms.<br/>

A comprehensive understanding of the MC38 tumor immune landscape at single-cell resolution is essential for advancing immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming immune suppression and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Integrating scRNA-seq with complementary multi-omics approaches, such as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, may further refine our knowledge of immune cell interactions within the TIME, ultimately guiding the development of more effective immunotherapies for colorectal cancer and other malignancies.<br/>
