Background
======
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are critical regulators of tissue homeostasis, immune responses, and barrier integrity. They are classified into distinct subsets (ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s) based on transcription factor usage and cytokine profiles, and their distribution and function vary significantly across tissues. IL-18 receptor 1 (IL-18R1), a key mediator of IL-18 signaling, is prominently expressed on skin-resident ILC2s, where it modulates inflammatory responses. In contrast, intestinal ILC2s express minimal to no IL-18R1, reflecting the tissue-specific adaptation of ILC subsets.<br/>

Il5-Cre-Tdt Il18r1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were initially generated to investigate the function of IL-18R1 specifically in skin ILC2s. However, given the broad importance of IL-18 signaling and the relevance of ILC subsets in the gut, we additionally examined these mice to characterize the frequency and distribution of ILC3s in the small intestinal lamina propria (SiLP). This approach also allowed us to address potential concerns related to tissue specificity and the impact of using a skin-targeted Cre system on intestinal ILC compartments.<br/>

Conclusion
======
In this preliminary analysis using two Il5-Cre-Tdt Il18r1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, we observed a trend toward reduced ILC2 frequencies; however, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Although intestinal ILC2s are generally considered IL-18R1â€“negative, these findings raise the possibility that IL-18R1 may play a developmental role in the ILC2 compartment. While Il18r1 fate-mapping models are currently unavailable, the generation of such mice would provide valuable insights into the potential contributions of IL-18 signaling to ILC2 development and lineage commitment.
