Background

IL-18 and IL-18R Expression in the Intestine: Cellular Specificity, Functional Significance, and Immunological Implications
Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a crucial pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a multifaceted role in mucosal immunity, particularly within the intestinal microenvironment. It belongs to the IL-1 cytokine family and is primarily produced as an inactive precursor (pro-IL-18) by epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in response to microbial and inflammatory stimuli. The active, mature form of IL-18 is generated through proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1, a process tightly regulated by inflammasomes such as NLRP3 and NLRC4. Once activated, IL-18 exerts its effects by binding to its receptor, IL-18R, a heterodimeric complex composed of IL18R1 (IL-18 receptor α) and IL18RAP (IL-18 receptor accessory protein). This receptor complex initiates intracellular signaling through MyD88 and downstream activation of NF-κB, MAPK, and other inflammatory pathways, leading to the transcriptional induction of cytokines, chemokines, and effector molecules that shape intestinal immune responses. <br/>

**The Dual Role of IL-18 in Intestinal Immunity and Inflammation**
The role of IL-18 in the intestine is highly context-dependent. Under homeostatic conditions, IL-18 contributes to the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity by promoting tight junction stability, mucus production, and epithelial regeneration. It also plays a key role in regulating the balance between protective and inflammatory immune responses, particularly through its effects on innate and adaptive immune cells. However, dysregulated IL-18 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple intestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colitis-associated colorectal cancer, and microbial dysbiosis-related conditions. Excessive IL-18 activity can drive chronic inflammation by enhancing the activation of pathogenic T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, whereas insufficient IL-18 signaling may compromise epithelial defense and host-microbiota equilibrium, increasing susceptibility to infections and tissue damage.<br/>

**IL18R1 Expression in the Intestinal Immune Landscape**
Our data reveal that IL18R1 is predominantly expressed in type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) within the intestinal mucosa, highlighting a selective and functionally relevant aspect of IL-18 signaling. ILC3s are a critical subset of innate lymphoid cells that contribute to mucosal immunity by producing IL-22, IL-17, and GM-CSF, cytokines essential for epithelial protection, antimicrobial defense, and immune homeostasis. The preferential expression of IL18R1 in ILC3s suggests a direct regulatory role of IL-18 in shaping their functional responses. Specifically, IL-18 signaling may enhance ILC3 survival, modulate their cytokine production, and influence their interactions with epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and other immune populations in the intestinal lamina propria.<br/>

Beyond ILC3s, IL18R1 expression has been observed in other immune subsets, including a subset of T helper (Th) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and certain myeloid populations. However, our findings suggest that in the intestinal microenvironment, ILC3s may serve as the predominant responders to IL-18 signaling. Given their role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and orchestrating local immune responses, the IL-18–ILC3 axis may represent a key regulatory pathway in mucosal immunity.<br/>

**Implications for Disease and Therapeutic Targeting**
The preferential expression of IL18R1 in ILC3s and its potential role in modulating their function raise important questions about IL-18's contributions to both protective and pathogenic immune responses in the intestine. In IBD, excessive IL-18 signaling has been linked to tissue damage and chronic inflammation, raising the possibility that IL-18R1-expressing ILC3s might contribute to disease exacerbation under dysregulated conditions. Conversely, in contexts of impaired IL-18 signaling, such as chronic infections or intestinal barrier dysfunction, ILC3-mediated responses may be compromised, leading to increased susceptibility to microbial invasion and epithelial injury.<br/>

Given these findings, targeting IL-18 or IL-18R signaling may offer novel therapeutic avenues for modulating intestinal inflammation. IL-18 blockade has been explored as a potential strategy for treating IBD, particularly in patients with excessive IL-18-driven inflammation. Conversely, strategies aimed at selectively enhancing IL-18 signaling in protective immune subsets, such as ILC3s, could be beneficial in conditions where mucosal immunity is compromised.<br/>

**Conclusion**
Our study provides novel insights into the cellular distribution and functional relevance of IL-18R signaling in the intestine. The predominant expression of IL18R1 in ILC3s suggests that IL-18 plays a key role in regulating ILC3-mediated immune responses, with potential implications for mucosal homeostasis, host defense, and inflammatory disease pathogenesis. Further research into the mechanistic interactions between IL-18, ILC3s, and other immune components will be essential for understanding the broader implications of this pathway in intestinal health and disease, as well as for developing targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating IL-18-driven immunity.<br/>
