Background
======
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), arises from dysregulated immune responses to environmental and microbial triggers in genetically predisposed individuals. A hallmark of IBD is the breakdown of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, which facilitates microbial translocation, aberrant immune activation, and chronic inflammation. The dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model recapitulates key features of UC, including epithelial erosion, neutrophil infiltration, and cytokine-mediated tissue damage, making it indispensable for dissecting mechanisms of mucosal immunity and inflammation.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a member of the IL-1 cytokine superfamily, is a pleiotropic mediator of intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Produced constitutively by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and myeloid cells, IL-18 engages its heterodimeric receptor (IL-18Rα/β) to orchestrate innate immune responses, regulate epithelial repair, and modulate interactions with the gut microbiota. Notably, IL-18 signaling is pivotal in maintaining the equilibrium between tolerogenic and inflammatory states in the lamina propria (LP). However, dysregulated IL-18 activity, driven by inflammasome hyperactivation or defective regulatory checkpoints, has been implicated in amplifying pathogenic Th1/Th17 responses and exacerbating colitis through mechanisms that remain incompletely resolved.

Emerging evidence highlights the central role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), particularly group 3 ILCs (ILC3s), as gatekeepers of intestinal immune balance. ILC3s, defined by their dependency on the transcription factor RORγt, secrete IL-22 to promote epithelial regeneration and fortify barrier function. Paradoxically, in chronic inflammation, ILC3s undergo plasticity-driven reprogramming toward an ILC1-like phenotype, characterized by T-bet upregulation and IFN-γ production, a transition potentiated by IL-12 and IL-18. This phenotypic shift disrupts mucosal homeostasis, fostering a pro-inflammatory milieu that perpetuates tissue damage. IL-18’s dual role in both sustaining ILC3-mediated barrier protection and driving pathogenic ILC1 conversion underscores its contextual duality in colitis, yet the molecular determinants governing this balance remain enigmatic.

To elucidate the spatiotemporal regulation of IL-18 signaling in ILC plasticity during colitis, we employed a genetic dissection strategy using Il18 knockout (Il18−/−) and conditional Il18r1-deficient mice (RorcCre Il18r1fl/fl), targeting IL-18R1 ablation in RORγt cells. High-dimensional flow cytometry of lamina propria leukocytes (LPLs) revealed dynamic shifts in ILC subsets, transcriptional regulators, and effector cytokine profiles under inflammatory stress. Our findings position IL-18 as a critical rheostat of ILC functional adaptation, with implications for therapeutic targeting of cytokine networks in IBD.
