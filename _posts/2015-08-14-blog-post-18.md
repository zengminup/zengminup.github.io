Background
======
*Salmonella Typhimurium* is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for gastrointestinal infections. Following oral ingestion, *Salmonella* colonizes the intestinal epithelium, breaching the mucosal barrier through microfold (M) cells in Peyer’s patches. Utilizing a type III secretion system (T3SS), *Salmonella* injects effector proteins into host cells, facilitating cytoskeletal rearrangement and bacterial uptake. Once internalized, the bacteria reside within the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole (SCV), where they evade host immune responses and replicate.

## **Innate Immune Responses in the Intestinal Lamina Propria**  
The host immune system initiates a rapid defense against *Salmonella* infection, with innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) playing a pivotal role in mucosal immunity. ILCs are heterogeneous populations that contribute to barrier integrity, inflammation, and antimicrobial defense.  

- **ILC3s**, primarily characterized by IL-22 and IL-17A production, enhance epithelial barrier function and promote antimicrobial peptide secretion.  
- **ILC1s**, which produce IFN-γ, mediate pro-inflammatory responses that can either aid in bacterial clearance or exacerbate tissue damage.  
- **IL-18-driven ILC plasticity** has been implicated in the conversion of ILC3s to an ILC1-like phenotype, potentially shifting immune responses during *Salmonella* infection.  

## **Flow Cytometric Analysis of ILC Dynamics**  
Flow cytometry-based profiling of intestinal lamina propria cells enables the characterization of ILC subset distribution, activation status, and cytokine production in response to infection. Analyzing these changes provides insight into host-pathogen interactions and immune evasion strategies employed by *Salmonella*.  

Understanding how *Salmonella* modulates ILC responses may reveal novel mechanisms of immune regulation and potential therapeutic targets for mitigating infection-induced intestinal inflammation.

Method
======
## **Bacterial Culture and Oral Infection Model**  
*Salmonella Typhimurium* (strain SL1344) was cultured in LB broth at 37°C with continuous shaking until reaching the mid-log phase (OD600 ≈ 0.6). Bacterial cultures were centrifuged at 5000 × *g* for 10 min, resuspended in sterile PBS, and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 10⁹ CFU/mL for infection.  

For oral infection, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice were fasted for 4 hours prior to bacterial administration. Mice were orally gavaged with 200 µL of the bacterial suspension, delivering 2 × 10⁸ CFU per mouse. Control groups received an equivalent volume of sterile PBS. Post-infection, mice were monitored for clinical symptoms, including weight loss and stool consistency, over a 7-day experimental period.  

## **Intestinal Tissue Processing and Enzymatic Digestion**  
At designated time points post-infection, mice were sacrificed, and intestinal tissues (ileum, colon) were harvested. Tissues were opened longitudinally, washed with cold PBS to remove luminal contents, and cut into small fragments (~1 cm). Epithelial cells were dissociated by incubation in HBSS containing 5 mM EDTA at 37°C with gentle agitation for 20 min. The remaining lamina propria tissue was digested using a collagenase/DNase I cocktail (Collagenase IV, 1 mg/mL; DNase I, 100 U/mL) in RPMI-1640 medium at 37°C for 40 min with intermittent shaking. The digestion reaction was quenched by adding fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the resulting single-cell suspension was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer. Cells were washed, pelleted, and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS) for flow cytometry analysis.  

## **Flow Cytometry Analysis of Innate Lymphoid Cells**  
Single-cell suspensions were incubated with Fc receptor blocking antibody (anti-CD16/CD32, 2 µg/mL) for 10 min on ice to prevent nonspecific binding. Cells were then stained with a panel of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies targeting lineage markers (CD45, CD3, CD19, NK1.1) and ILC subset-specific markers (CD127, CD90.2, NKp46, RORγt). Dead cells were excluded using a viability dye. Stained samples were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software.  

ILC subsets were gated based on the absence of lineage markers (Lin⁻) and the expression of CD127. Further differentiation of ILC subsets (ILC1, ILC2, ILC3) was performed using respective surface or intracellular markers. Cytokine production was assessed via intracellular staining following ex vivo stimulation with PMA (50 ng/mL) and ionomycin (500 ng/mL) in the presence of brefeldin A for 4 hours.  

## **Statistical Analysis**  
Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo, and statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Prism. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, with *p*-values < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
