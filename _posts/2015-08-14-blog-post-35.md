Background
======
The intestinal mucosa serves as a dynamic interface where nutrient absorption, microbial sensing, and immune regulation are tightly coordinated. Spatial compartmentalization of epithelial and immune functions enables the intestine to maintain homeostasis under constant environmental exposure. With recent advances in spatial transcriptomics, the spatial organization and cellular diversity of the gut have been characterized with increasing resolution. Notably, public datasets now provide high-quality spatial maps of the murine intestine under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, a widely used model of acute epithelial injury and innate immune activation, recapitulates key pathological features of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among cytokines implicated in gut homeostasis and inflammation, interleukin-18 (IL-18), a member of the IL-1 cytokine family, plays dual roles in epithelial barrier defense and immune modulation. However, its spatial and temporal regulation across intestinal regions during acute inflammation remains poorly defined. In this study, publicly available spatial transcriptomic datasets were analyzed to investigate the region-specific expression dynamics of IL-18 at distinct time points during DSS-induced colitis. The results reveal a temporally dynamic and spatially restricted IL-18 expression pattern, providing insights into how localized immune-epithelial interactions contribute to intestinal tissue adaptation during inflammatory stress.
