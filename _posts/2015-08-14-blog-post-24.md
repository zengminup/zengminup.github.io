Background
======
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic ecosystem that significantly influences the progression of malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The TME consists of a variety of non-neoplastic cells, including immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix components, which together create a milieu that can either suppress or promote tumor progression. Among the cellular components of the TME, immune cells play pivotal roles in both tumor surveillance and immune evasion, contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and the response to therapeutic interventions, including immune checkpoint blockade and targeted therapies.

Immune cell infiltration into the tumor is a hallmark of CRC and has been shown to correlate with patient prognosis. Infiltrating immune cells include a wide array of subsets, such as T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cells. These cells are known to modulate tumor progression through complex signaling pathways, and their interactions within the TME can be either beneficial (tumor suppression) or detrimental (tumor promotion). For instance, cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) and NK cells can mediate direct tumor cell killing, whereas regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) often contribute to immune suppression, promoting tumor escape.

Despite the well-established role of immune cells in CRC, the intricate molecular mechanisms that govern immune-tumor interactions remain incompletely understood. High-resolution methods that can characterize the full spectrum of cellular diversity and identify gene expression signatures associated with immune-tumor interactions are essential for advancing our understanding of the TME. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells, enabling the identification of novel immune cell subpopulations, their activation states, and their roles in modulating the tumor immune landscape.

In this study, we utilized the MC38 mouse tumor model to investigate the immune microenvironment of CRC using scRNA-seq. The MC38 model, a widely used syngeneic mouse colon cancer model, closely recapitulates many aspects of human CRC, including tumor growth, immune infiltration, and response to immunotherapy. By profiling the transcriptomes of individual immune and tumor cells, we aimed to delineate the cellular composition and gene expression patterns that characterize the immune response to the tumor and to uncover potential biomarkers for therapeutic targeting. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the TME in the MC38 model, offering insights into the immune dynamics that drive tumor progression and therapeutic resistance in CRC.

The cell capture efficiency of the Tumor01 sample is low, but B cells are missing and Cd4 T cells are underrepresented. This makes it difficult to accurately analyze their changes and precisely reflect the variation in cell proportions. It is recommended to focus on the lymphocytes that have already been detected.




Method
======
Tumor Model and Cell Isolation
The MC38 mouse model, a C57BL/6-derived colon adenocarcinoma cell line, was utilized for this study. Mice were subcutaneously implanted with MC38 cells to establish tumor growth. Once tumors reached an appropriate size, tumor tissues were excised and dissociated into a single-cell suspension for downstream analysis. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD45+ cells) were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on the expression of CD45, a cell surface marker that identifies immune cells. This sorting strategy allowed us to specifically target and analyze the immune infiltrates within the tumor, which are crucial for understanding the immune landscape in the TME.

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
Following immune cell isolation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) libraries were prepared using the BGI single-cell sequencing platform, a high-throughput technology capable of capturing transcriptomic data from thousands of individual cells. This platform utilizes microfluidic-based technology to encapsulate single cells in droplets, followed by reverse transcription and barcoding of the resulting cDNA, ensuring that each transcript is uniquely tagged for its cell of origin. The resulting libraries were subjected to sequencing, generating deep transcriptomic profiles for each individual cell.

Data Processing and Quality Control
Raw sequencing data were processed to generate high-quality gene expression matrices for each single cell. Quality control steps were implemented to filter out low-quality cells, such as those with low gene counts, high mitochondrial gene expression, or other technical artifacts. Cells were also filtered based on their unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts to ensure that only cells with sufficient transcript coverage were included in subsequent analyses.

Data Analysis
The processed scRNA-seq data were analyzed using the Scanpy package, a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and visualizing single-cell RNA-seq data. We first performed standard preprocessing steps, including normalization, log-transformation, and dimensionality reduction. We then applied clustering algorithms to identify distinct cell populations within the TME, based on their gene expression profiles. We used both unsupervised clustering techniques (e.g., Leiden clustering) and manual annotation based on known immune markers to define cell populations such as T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and tumor cells.

Differential gene expression analysis was conducted to identify genes that were differentially expressed between immune cell subsets or between tumor and immune cells. We also utilized trajectory analysis methods to examine the differentiation and activation states of immune cells within the TME, particularly focusing on T cell subsets and their potential roles in anti-tumor immunity.

Finally, to understand the interactions between immune cells and tumor cells, we performed cell-cell communication analysis using publicly available databases of ligand-receptor interactions. This analysis allowed us to identify key signaling pathways that might mediate immune-tumor interactions and to propose potential therapeutic targets for modulating the TME.

By leveraging scRNA-seq and advanced computational tools, this study provides a high-resolution view of the immune landscape in the MC38 tumor model, shedding light on the complex cellular interactions that define the TME in CRC.
