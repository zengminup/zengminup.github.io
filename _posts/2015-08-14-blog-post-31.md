excerpt: 'Interleukin-18 (IL-18) plays a pivotal role in regulating intestinal immune homeostasis. Here, we show that IL-18 promotes the phenotypic conversion of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) into ILC1s within the intestinal mucosa. This process underscores the functional plasticity of ILCs and provides new insights into the mechanisms by which IL-18 modulates mucosal immunity, with potential implications for inflammatory bowel disease and other intestinal disorders.<br/>

Background
======
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are critical components of the mucosal immune system, providing rapid responses to pathogens and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Among these, group 3 ILCs (ILC3s), characterized by the expression of the transcription factor RORγt, play a pivotal role in intestinal immunity through the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) and other cytokines that promote epithelial barrier integrity and antimicrobial defense. A hallmark of ILC3 biology is their remarkable plasticity, which enables them to transdifferentiate into other ILC subsets in response to environmental and cytokine signals.

Notably, natural cytotoxicity receptor–positive (NCR⁺) ILC3s, a subset expressing NKp46 in mice or NKp44 in humans, exhibit enhanced functional flexibility compared to NCR⁻ ILC3s. Under inflammatory conditions or in the presence of specific cytokines such as IL-12, IL-15, or IL-18, NCR⁺ ILC3s can downregulate RORγt and upregulate T-bet, acquiring an ILC1-like phenotype characterized by the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). This phenotypic shift contributes to shaping the intestinal immune landscape and may have both protective and pathogenic consequences, depending on the context.

Although considerable progress has been made in defining the transcriptional and environmental factors that regulate ILC plasticity, the precise molecular mechanisms driving the conversion of ILC3s, particularly NCR⁺ ILC3s, into ILC1s in the intestinal microenvironment remain incompletely understood. Elucidating these mechanisms is critical for advancing our understanding of mucosal immunoregulation and identifying novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory bowel disease and other intestinal inflammatory disorders.

Recent evidence highlights interleukin-18 (IL-18) as a key cytokine modulating ILC plasticity within mucosal tissues. IL-18, a member of the IL-1 family, is broadly expressed in epithelial cells and immune cells and is known for its potent ability to induce IFN-γ production in both innate and adaptive immune cells. In the context of intestinal immunity, IL-18 levels are elevated during inflammation, where it shapes the local immune response by promoting type 1 immunity.

Studies have shown that IL-18, together with IL-12, can drive the phenotypic conversion of ILC3s toward an ILC1-like fate by inducing T-bet expression and downregulating RORγt, thereby enhancing IFN-γ production and cytotoxic potential. Notably, this effect is particularly pronounced in NCR⁺ ILC3s, which are poised for plasticity and can rapidly respond to cytokine cues in the inflamed gut. The IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) is expressed on subsets of ILC3s, further supporting a direct role for IL-18 signaling in mediating this transition.

Emerging data from murine models and human intestinal biopsies suggest that dysregulated IL-18 signaling contributes to intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, by skewing the ILC compartment toward a proinflammatory ILC1-dominated profile. Understanding the precise contribution of IL-18 in orchestrating ILC3-to-ILC1 conversion may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

Results
======

- **IL-18 Deficiency and ILC Subsets**:  
  IL-18 deficiency leads to a significant reduction in NKp46⁺ ILC3s within the small intestine and a concomitant decrease in ILC1s in the colon, emphasizing the essential role of IL-18 in regulating the distribution and maintenance of ILC subsets across different intestinal regions.<br/><br/>

- **Impact on IL-22 Secretion**:  
  Despite the reduction in ILC1s and NKp46⁺ ILC3s, IL-18 knockout does not impair the IL-22 secretion capability of ILC3s. This suggests that IL-18's role in mucosal immunity is not directly related to IL-22 production, highlighting its distinct functions in modulating immune responses.<br/><br/>

- **IL-18 and ILC3 Plasticity**:  
  IL-18 specifically influences IL-22⁻ fate-mapped ILC3s, promoting their conversion into ILC1s. This IL-18-driven plasticity underscores the dynamic nature of ILC subsets in the intestinal immune environment and their ability to adapt in response to cytokine signaling.<br/><br/>

- **Role in Intestinal Immunity**:  
  These findings provide compelling evidence that IL-18 is a key regulator of ILC3-to-ILC1 conversion, which plays a crucial role in shaping the immune landscape of the intestine. The ability of IL-18 to induce ILC3 plasticity has significant implications for understanding the regulation of mucosal immunity and inflammatory processes in the gut.<br/><br/>
