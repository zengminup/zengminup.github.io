Background
======
The intestinal immune system orchestrates a dynamic equilibrium between pro-inflammatory defenses and regulatory tolerance to preserve mucosal homeostasis while mounting calibrated responses against pathogenic threats. Central to this balance are innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which function as sentinels and effectors of tissue immunity. Among these, group 3 ILCs (ILC3s), defined by their reliance on the transcription factor RORγt, are indispensable architects of barrier integrity. Through the production of IL-22, ILC3s stimulate epithelial regeneration, enhance mucus secretion via goblet cell activation, and enforce spatial segregation between commensal microbiota and the underlying lamina propria. This homeostatic program is critically regulated by STAT3, a pleiotropic transcription factor that transduces signals from cytokines such as IL-23 and IL-6, which are elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and essential for ILC3 survival, proliferation, and effector function.

Notably, a subset of ILC3s expressing natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), including NKp46 (NCR1), exhibits remarkable contextual plasticity. Under homeostatic conditions, NCR+ ILC3s collaborate with mononuclear phagocytes to surveil the epithelial interface, maintaining microbial containment and tissue repair. However, in chronic inflammatory environments—such as those driven by IL-12, IL-15, or IL-18—these cells undergo transcriptional reprogramming, downregulating RORγt and upregulating T-bet, thereby adopting an ILC1-like phenotype characterized by IFN-γ production. This plasticity, while evolutionarily conserved to combat intracellular pathogens, becomes maladaptive in IBD, where sustained IFN-γ secretion exacerbates epithelial apoptosis, disrupts tight junctions, and amplifies macrophage-driven inflammation through STAT1/IRF1 signaling. Despite advances, the molecular regulators that license or constrain NCR+ ILC plasticity, particularly within the STAT3-IL-23 axis, remain poorly defined.

STAT3, a nexus for multiple cytokine signals, is uniquely positioned to modulate ILC3 fate decisions. In addition to mediating IL-23-dependent IL-22 production, STAT3 cooperates with AhR to reinforce RORγt expression, thereby stabilizing ILC3 identity. Conversely, inflammatory cues that activate STAT1/STAT4 (e.g., IFN-γ and IL-12) antagonize STAT3 signaling, creating a molecular "toggle" that governs the ILC3-ILC1 equilibrium. Intriguingly, single-cell transcriptomic studies have identified a STAT3-dependent gene signature in NCR+ ILC3s that correlates with mucosal healing, suggesting that STAT3 loss may not only impair protective functions but also promote pathogenic plasticity. Nevertheless, the causal role of STAT3 in restraining NCR+ ILC-driven immunopathology during colitis remains untested, leaving a critical gap in understanding how cytokine networks shape ILC functional states in disease.

To dissect the cell-intrinsic role of STAT3 in NCR+ ILCs, we employed Ncr1-Cre Stat3fl/fl mice, enabling selective ablation of STAT3 in NKp46+ cells while preserving STAT3 activity in other lineages. By integrating spatial transcriptomics, mass cytometry, and microbiota-depletion models, we investigated how STAT3 deficiency alters ILC3 transcriptional landscapes, cytokine profiles, and crosstalk with epithelial and stromal compartments during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Our data reveal that STAT3 acts as a gatekeeper of NCR+ ILC3 identity, restraining their conversion into IFN-γ+ effectors while promoting IL-22-mediated barrier repair—a dual mechanism whose disruption exacerbates colitis severity. These findings redefine STAT3 as a molecular linchpin at the intersection of ILC plasticity and mucosal immunity, with therapeutic implications for STAT3-targeted therapies in IBD.
