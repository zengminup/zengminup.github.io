Background
======
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a heterogeneous family of lymphocytes that play critical roles in mucosal immunity, tissue homeostasis, and inflammation, particularly within the intestinal environment. Unlike adaptive lymphocytes, ILCs lack antigen-specific receptors but rapidly respond to environmental cues through cytokine production. Based on transcription factor profiles and effector functions, ILCs are classified into three major groups: ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s. Among them, ILC3s are defined by expression of the transcription factor **RORγt** (encoded by *Rorc*), which governs their differentiation and functional programming.

Rorc fate-mapping models, typically based on **Rorc^Cre^ × Rosa26^fl-stop-fl-tdTomato^** mice, provide a permanent genetic labeling of all cells that have expressed *Rorc* at any point during development. These models have been pivotal in dissecting ILC developmental trajectories and uncovering the remarkable plasticity within the ILC compartment. Notably, while ILC3s are the canonical *Rorc*-expressing subset, fate-mapping studies have revealed that a substantial fraction of intestinal ILC1s also derive from *Rorc*-expressing precursors. These “ex-ILC3” ILC1s have lost RORγt expression but retain the permanent fate-mapping label, highlighting the dynamic interconversion potential between ILC subsets.

IL-22, a cytokine critically involved in epithelial barrier maintenance, antimicrobial peptide induction, and tissue repair, is predominantly produced by ILC3s in the intestine. Il22 fate-mapping models, such as **Il22^Cre^ × Rosa26^fl-stop-fl-tdTomato^** mice, allow the identification of cells that have actively transcribed *Il22*, providing valuable insights into the cellular sources and dynamics of IL-22 production during homeostasis and inflammation. Although ILC3s represent the principal innate source of IL-22, under specific inflammatory conditions, other cell types, including subsets of CD4^+^ T cells (e.g., Th17 and Th22 cells), may also contribute.

Expression patterns of *Rorc* and *Il22* are tightly linked to ILC subset identity. ILC3s robustly express both *Rorc* and *Il22*, whereas ILC1s lack active *Rorc* transcription and typically produce IFN-γ, not IL-22. However, fate-mapping experiments have shown that a proportion of ILC1s bear a *Rorc* fate-mapping label, reflecting their origin from RORγt-expressing progenitors. In contrast, ILC2s, marked by GATA3 expression, generally do not express *Rorc* or *Il22* and are primarily associated with type 2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13.

Collectively, the integration of *Rorc* and *Il22* fate-mapping approaches has significantly advanced our understanding of ILC heterogeneity and plasticity, particularly in the context of intestinal homeostasis, host defense, and the dynamic adaptation of the immune system to environmental challenges.
