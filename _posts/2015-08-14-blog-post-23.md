Background
======
The study of chromatin accessibility has emerged as a crucial approach for understanding gene regulation at the single-cell level, particularly in complex tissue environments such as the intestinal epithelium and lamina propria. Single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) has proven to be an invaluable technique for mapping chromatin accessibility across individual cells, offering insights into the regulatory landscapes that govern cell-specific gene expression profiles. By identifying accessible chromatin regions, scATAC-seq enables the exploration of cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and insulators, which are pivotal in regulating cellular responses to stimuli and developmental processes. This approach is particularly powerful for dissecting the heterogeneity of immune and non-immune cell populations within tissues and understanding how alterations in chromatin structure influence cellular functions in health and disease.

In the context of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), understanding how inflammatory mediators modulate chromatin accessibility is crucial. Interleukin-18 binding protein (Il18bp) is known to regulate immune responses by binding to IL-18, a cytokine implicated in inflammatory processes within the gut. Previous research has demonstrated that IL-18 plays a significant role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, and dysregulation of IL-18 signaling may contribute to chronic inflammatory conditions. The Il18bp−/− mouse model provides a valuable tool for investigating the consequences of IL-18 dysregulation on chromatin accessibility and immune cell function in the gut.

This study aims to utilize scATAC-seq to assess chromatin accessibility in intestinal immune cells from wild-type (WT) and Il18bp−/− mice. By comparing chromatin landscapes between these genotypes, we seek to uncover how the absence of Il18bp influences the chromatin accessibility of key immune cell populations, particularly myeloid cells, macrophages, and other immune effectors in the context of intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, our investigation will examine the potential differential enrichment of metabolic and innate immune pathways, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that may drive inflammatory responses in the absence of Il18bp. Ultimately, this analysis will shed light on the role of chromatin remodeling in regulating immune responses during intestinal inflammation and identify potential therapeutic targets for IBD and other related disorders.

Through comprehensive analysis of scATAC-seq data, we aim to provide a high-resolution map of chromatin accessibility that can guide future studies on gene regulation in the gut under inflammatory conditions, thereby contributing to the understanding of IBD pathogenesis and advancing therapeutic strategies targeting chromatin-modifying pathways.

Distal colons from littermate WT and Il18bp−/− mice fed 0.5% DSS for 7 days followed by 7 days of normal drinking water were flushed with ice-cold PBS 5x to remove the luminal contents, opened longitudinally, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. On the day of nuclei isolation, the snap-frozen colons were put into dounce tissue grinders containing 500 μL ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% NP-40, 0.01% Digitonin, 1% BSA, prepared in nuclease-free water). Colon tissues were then gently dounced 20 times with pestle on ice and incubated on ice for 5 min. Thereafter, 1 mL of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, prepared in nuclease-free water) was added to the samples which were sequentially filtered through 70 μm and 20 μm cell strainers into pre-chilled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The homogenates were centrifuged at 450 g, 4°C for 4 min to pellet the nuclei. After centrifugation, supernatants were carefully removed. The nuclei were resuspended in 1X ice-cold Nuclei Buffer (10x Genomics, PN 2000153/2000207) and sent to Harvard University Bauer Sequencing Core for sn-ATAC sequencing.

Nuclei were counted on the LUNA-FX7 Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems) using fluorescence detection for viability with an acridine orange/propidium iodide stain (Part No. F23011). Samples had viabilities between 1.6% and 10.3% with concentration ranges from ∼5,325-6,500 nuclei/μL. After counting, all samples were transposed in a bulk solution and then loaded into individual wells of Chip H per the user guide from 10x Genomics, no alterations were made at any step of the protocol (Part No. CG000209 Rev G). GEMs were formed targeting 10,000 nuclei and GEM incubation completed immediately after. Post GEMs were cleaned up and library construction completed using PCR amplification for a total of 9 cycles with each sample receiving a unique single index (Part No. 1000212). Final libraries were diluted and ran using the High Sensitivity D5000 tape and reagents (Part No. 5067–5592 & 5067–5593) on the 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were quantified via Kapa qPCR using the Complete Universal Kit (Part No. 07960140001, Roche Sequencing Solutions) and the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq instrument using the parameters outlined in the user guide (Read1: 50 bp, i7 index: 8 bp, i5 index: 16 bp, Read2: 50 bp). After sequencing and demultiplexing data are analyzed with Cell Ranger ATAC pipeline.

We performed snATAC-seq processing with R package ArchR (v1.0.2) in R environment (v4.2.1). All the functions mentioned below are from ArchR unless otherwise stated. We used the built-in mouse genome (mm10) in ArchR package as the reference genome. For quality control, we filtered out cells with less than 1000 unique fragments and 4 TSS enrichment scores, which was measured by the ratio between chromatin accessibility at TSS regions and their flanking regions. To remove possible doublets, we used addDoubletScores and filterDoublets functions which generated pseudo-doublets to identify cells similar to generated doublets and removed them. After pre-processing snATAC-seq samples individually, we merged WT and Il18bp−/− samples together for combined analysis. 

To identify cell clusters for cell type annotation, we performed dimensionality reduction and clustering. We used addIterativeLSI which compute dimensionality reduction with genome-wide 500-bp tiles using iterative Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) normalization followed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) clustering to identify most variable features from each cluster for following iterations. We adjusted detailed parameters such as clustering resolutions, subsampling cell counts, variable feature counts, and dimensions for identifying cell types with all the cells, myeloid cells, and macrophages. We identified cell clusters using addClusters with resolution 0.8 and addUMAP with default parameters.

For cell type annotation, we used gene scores which was calculated with ArchR’s gene score model that takes account of accessibility near gene body and TSS with decreasing weights with increasing distances. We identified major cell types with initial clustering results by using canonical cell type markers and marker genes identified with getMarkerFeatures function. Marker genes with less than 0.01 FDR and more than 1.0 log2 fold changes were visualized with heatmaps. Several selected marker genes were further inspected and visualized on UMAP coordinates with imputed gene scores after performing addImputeWeights function. After identifying major cell types, we generated pseudo-bulk replicates for each identified major cell type with addGroupCoverages function. With those replicates, we used addReproduciblePeakSet function with MACS2 to generate a reproducible peak set for single cell peak matrix. With the peak matrix, we calculated marker peaks with getMarkerFeatures and visualized them with heatmap (FDR <0.05, Log2FC > 0.5).

To compare enrichment of metabolic and innate immune pathways between WT and Il18bp−/− cells for each major cell type, we calculated average gene scores for all the genes in one pathway for Il18bp−/− cells and WT cells by each cell type. We divided calculated average scores for Il18bp−/− cells by average scores for WT cells to measure differences within the cell type between the conditions. Percentage of the cells with the gene scores were calculated with the same method but with binarized gene scores. This process was repeated for all the pathways and the final values were visualized with dot plots with R package ggplot2 (v3.3.6) with scaled colors for normalized average gene score values and dot sizes for percentage of cells with the gene scores for cell type and condition combination for each pathway. 

To calculate pathway enrichment at single cell and single gene level for macrophages, we used imputed gene scores to measure gene scores of each cell. Using R package pheatmap (v1.0.12), we visualized the imputed gene scores for each cell and gene with heatmap and clustered both genes and cells with hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distances. To compare peak accessibility around selected genes of interest between WT and Il18bp−/− macrophages, we used plotBrowserTrack function with peak tile size of 100 with 50,000 bp upstream and downstream of the TSS regions.
