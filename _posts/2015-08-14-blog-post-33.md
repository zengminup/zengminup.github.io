Background
======
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play critical roles in tissue homeostasis, immune defense, and inflammation, yet their developmental plasticity and lineage relationships remain incompletely understood. To facilitate precise lineage tracing and fate-mapping of ILC subsets, we employed a dual-reporter mouse model—Tbx21-Cre-Gata3^ZsGreen-fl/fl^; Rosa26^TdTomato^—which allows for the visualization of T-bet and GATA3 expression histories via ZsGreen and TdTomato reporters, respectively. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using flow cytometry with FITC and PE-conjugated antibodies to verify genotype and fluorescence reporter expression. This approach provides a reliable and minimally invasive method for genotypic screening and supports downstream applications in ILC differentiation, plasticity, and functional studies in both steady-state and inflammatory conditions.

Lineage Tracing and Fate Mapping of ILC Subsets:
This dual-reporter system enables retrospective identification of cells that have expressed Tbx21 or Gata3, key transcription factors for ILC1 and ILC2/3 lineages, respectively. It is especially useful for tracking plasticity between ILC subsets under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.

Dissecting Transcriptional Regulation in ILC Differentiation:
The Cre-loxP system driven by Tbx21 allows for conditional manipulation of target genes in T-bet–expressing cells, providing insights into how transcriptional networks guide ILC maturation and effector programming.

Studying ILC Plasticity and Transdifferentiation:
ILCs are known for their phenotypic flexibility in response to cytokines and tissue cues. This model allows for in vivo observation of transitional states, such as GATA3^+ to T-bet^+ conversion, relevant in inflammation, infection, and cancer models.

Modeling Chronic Inflammation and Tissue Remodeling:
Using tissue-specific readouts from ZsGreen and TdTomato expression, researchers can assess how ILCs contribute to chronic inflammatory diseases such as colitis, asthma, or psoriasis, including spatial and temporal mapping of ILC dynamics.

Validating Cytokine-Driven Reprogramming (e.g., IL-12, IL-18):
This mouse model supports studies on how cytokines like IL-12 and IL-18 drive ILC reprogramming, particularly in the gut or skin, helping to uncover mechanisms of immune adaptation and dysfunction.

Integration with Multi-omics and Imaging:
The dual fluorescence system is compatible with FACS, confocal microscopy, and single-cell multi-omics approaches (scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq), enabling integrative analyses of ILC states across tissues and disease models.
