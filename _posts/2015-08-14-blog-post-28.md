Background
======
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are critical regulators of tissue homeostasis and immune responses. In the skin, ILC2s are the predominant ILC subset, playing essential roles in maintaining barrier integrity and responding to environmental challenges.
Cpt1a, a key enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation, has been implicated in regulating cellular metabolism in immune cells. However, its role in skin-resident ILCs remains unclear.
To investigate the functional impact of Cpt1a deletion in ILCs, we utilized Rorc-Cre Cpt1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and performed flow cytometric profiling of skin ILC populations, comparing them to wild-type (WT) controls.

Initial analysis revealed a decrease in both the frequency and absolute number of skin ILCs in Rorc-Cre Cpt1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice compared to WT controls. . However, as these results are preliminary, further validation with larger sample sizes and functional assays will be necessary to confirm the impact of Cpt1a deletion on skin ILC homeostasis.

Method
======
Sample Preparation
Skin tissues were harvested from WT and Rorc-Cre Cpt1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Single-cell suspensions were generated by enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation, followed by filtration through a 70 μm cell strainer.

Flow Cytometry Staining
Cells were stained with a lineage cocktail to exclude non-ILC populations. The lineage markers used included:

CD3ε, CD5, CD19, B220, CD11b, CD11c, NK1.1, FcεRI, TER-119, and Gr-1.

Lineage-negative (Lin⁻) cells were subsequently analyzed for cytokine production using intracellular staining for:

IL-5 (as a marker of ILC2 function)

IL-17A (to assess potential ILC3-like responses)

Live/dead discrimination was performed to exclude dead cells.

Flow Cytometry Acquisition and Analysis
Samples were analyzed using FlowJo software. ILC populations were gated as Lin⁻, CD45⁺, and further analyzed based on cytokine expression profiles.
