CIBERSORTx is a suite of machine learning tools for the assessment of cellular abundance and cell type-specific gene expression patterns from bulk tissue transcriptome profiles. With this framework, single-cell or bulk-sorted RNA sequencing data can be used to learn molecular signatures of distinct cell types from a small collection of biospecimens. These signatures can then be repeatedly applied to characterize cellular heterogeneity from bulk tissue transcriptomes without physical cell isolation. <br/>
