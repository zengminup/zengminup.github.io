The intestinal epithelium is a dynamic and multifunctional tissue essential for nutrient absorption, barrier integrity, and immune surveillance. Its homeostasis is maintained through continuous renewal driven by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) located at the base of the crypts. These ISCs give rise to transit-amplifying (TA) progenitors, which subsequently differentiate into diverse specialized epithelial lineages, including absorptive enterocytes, secretory goblet cells, Paneth cells (PCs), and enteroendocrine cells. Characterizing the heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is critical for understanding gut physiology, tissue regeneration, and responses to environmental or pathological challenges.<br/>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative approach to dissect cellular diversity and transcriptional dynamics at single-cell resolution. Recent scRNA-seq studies of the intestinal epithelium have revealed previously unrecognized cellular states, lineage intermediates, and gene regulatory programs, advancing our understanding of epithelial biology in both homeostatic and diseased conditions.<br/>

In this study, we applied Seurat to perform comprehensive single-cell analysis of gut IECs, enabling unbiased identification and characterization of major epithelial subsets.<br/>

- **Enterocytes:** the primary absorptive cells, marked by genes such as *ALPI, SLC26A3, TMEM37,* and *FABP2*.
- **Goblet cells:** mucus-secreting cells involved in barrier maintenance, marked by *ZG16, CLCA1, FFAR4, TFF3,* and *SPINK4*.
- **Paneth cells (PCs):** secretory cells providing antimicrobial peptides and niche support, marked by *LYZ* (and its mouse orthologs *Lyz1, Lyz2*), *CA7, SPIB, CA4,* and *FKBP1A*.
- **Enteroendocrine cells:** hormone-producing cells regulating gut physiology, marked by *CHGA, CHGB, CPE, NEUROD1,* and *PYY*.
- **Progenitor cells:** early lineage-committed cells, marked by *SOX9, CDK6, MUC4, FABP5, PLA2G2A,* and *LCN2*.
- **Transient-amplifying (TA) cells:** rapidly proliferating intermediates, marked by *KI67, PCNA, TOP2A, CCNA2,* and *MCM5*.
- **Stem cells:** multipotent ISCs sustaining epithelial renewal, marked by *LGR5, RGMB, SMOC2,* and *ASCL2*.

This integrative single-cell framework provides a detailed transcriptional atlas of the intestinal epithelium and lays the groundwork for investigating cell typeâ€“specific functions, differentiation pathways, and regulatory mechanisms under physiological and pathological states.<br/>
