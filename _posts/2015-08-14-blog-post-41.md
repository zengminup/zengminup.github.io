Background
======
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are pivotal regulators of mucosal immunity and intestinal homeostasis, whose functional states are tightly controlled by cytokines including interleukin-18 (IL-18). Among ILC subsets, group 3 ILCs (ILC3s), defined by expression of the transcription factor RORγt and production of cytokines such as IL-22 and IL-17, play a critical role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Notably, ILC3s exhibit considerable plasticity, enabling their transdifferentiation into ILC1-like cells upon inflammatory stimuli. This phenotypic conversion is marked by downregulation of RORγt and upregulation of T-bet, resulting in a functional shift from type 3 to type 1 immune responses.<br/>

Fate-mapping studies using Rorc^CreERT2 models (Rorc^fm) have demonstrated that a substantial fraction of ILC1s in inflamed intestinal tissues are derived from ex-ILC3s. Conditional knockout of Rorc significantly impairs this transition, highlighting the essential role of RORγt lineage stability in controlling ILC plasticity. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, augmented ILC3-to-ILC1 conversion correlates with exacerbated mucosal inflammation and epithelial damage, likely reflecting a maladaptive immune response whereby the loss of protective ILC3 functions and gain of pro-inflammatory ILC1 characteristics contribute to disease progression.<br/>

IL-18 has been implicated as a key cytokine modulating ILC activation and plasticity; however, its precise role in shaping the transcriptional landscape of colonic ILCs remains to be fully elucidated. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers an unparalleled tool to resolve cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics at single-cell resolution. In this study, scRNA-seq was applied to colonic ILCs isolated from mice subjected to two rounds of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment, analyzed at day 34 post-induction. This model replicates chronic intestinal inflammation and enables comprehensive profiling of how IL-18 deficiency influences ILC subset composition, gene expression programs, and plasticity, particularly the ILC3-to-ILC1 transdifferentiation.<br/>

This integrative single-cell transcriptomic approach provides critical insights into IL-18–mediated regulation of ILC phenotypes and advances understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ILC plasticity during chronic intestinal inflammation, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting IBD.<br/>
