Background
======
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) constitute a diverse group of immune cells that play critical roles in tissue homeostasis, inflammation, and host defense, particularly at barrier surfaces such as the intestinal mucosa and skin. Among ILC subsets, those producing interleukin-22 (IL-22) are essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and orchestrating protective immune responses. IL-22–producing ILC3s contribute to mucosal barrier function by inducing antimicrobial peptides and promoting tissue repair. However, accumulating evidence reveals significant plasticity within ILC populations, whereby cells can dynamically alter cytokine expression profiles in response to environmental cues.<br/>

Fate-mapping strategies using genetically encoded reporters have emerged as powerful tools to trace the lineage and functional history of specific cell populations in vivo. IL-22 fate-mapping models enable the permanent labeling of cells that have expressed IL-22 at any point, thus allowing discrimination between IL-22–experienced (IL22-fm⁺) and naive or IL-22–non-expressing (IL22-fm⁻) cells. This distinction is critical for understanding the developmental trajectories, functional heterogeneity, and plasticity of ILCs in physiological and pathological contexts.<br/>

Single-cell transcriptomic technologies have revolutionized the ability to resolve cellular heterogeneity and to dissect gene expression programs at an unprecedented resolution. Applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to IL-22 fate-mapped ILCs provides a powerful approach to characterize the molecular signatures associated with IL22-fm⁺ versus IL22-fm⁻ subsets, revealing insights into their lineage relationships, activation states, and potential functional specialization.<br/>
