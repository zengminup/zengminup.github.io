Background
======
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), both of which are characterized by chronic, relapsing intestinal inflammation driven by a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation, and environmental factors. Among the experimental models used to study UC, the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model is widely regarded as one of the most effective due to its rapid onset, high reproducibility, and strong resemblance to the pathophysiological features of human UC.

Mechanisms of DSS-Induced Colitis
DSS is a sulfated polysaccharide that exerts its effects by directly damaging the intestinal epithelial barrier, leading to increased intestinal permeability. This disruption allows luminal antigens, including bacterial components, to penetrate the mucosa, triggering a robust immune response. The ensuing inflammation is characterized by extensive immune cell infiltration, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18), and significant histopathological damage, including epithelial erosion, crypt loss, and goblet cell depletion. These pathological hallmarks closely resemble those observed in human UC, making the DSS model particularly suitable for studying disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.

Immune Responses in DSS-Induced Colitis
The DSS model is extensively used to dissect the contributions of both innate and adaptive immune cells in colonic inflammation. Neutrophils are among the first responders following epithelial damage, releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that exacerbate tissue injury. Monocytes and macrophages are also recruited to the inflamed mucosa, where they promote inflammation via the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contribute to the resolution phase by clearing apoptotic cells and debris.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), particularly group 3 ILCs (ILC3s), play a pivotal role in mucosal immunity and epithelial homeostasis. In the context of DSS-induced colitis, ILC3s have been shown to undergo plasticity, transitioning into an ILC1-like phenotype under inflammatory conditions, driven by cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18. This shift contributes to heightened IFN-γ production, further amplifying intestinal inflammation. Additionally, adaptive immune responses mediated by T cells are crucial in chronic colitis. DSS-induced colitis is primarily driven by innate immunity; however, in chronic settings, T cell subsets, including Th1, Th17, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), become increasingly involved, shaping disease progression and resolution.

Applications in Therapeutic Research
Given its robust inflammatory response and close resemblance to human UC, the DSS model is widely utilized for evaluating potential therapeutic interventions. Various pharmacological agents, including small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, and biologics targeting cytokine signaling (e.g., anti-TNF therapy, IL-23 blockade), have been tested in this model to assess their efficacy before clinical translation. Additionally, dietary interventions, microbiota-modulating strategies, and cell-based therapies, such as mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, have been explored using the DSS model, providing valuable insights into novel therapeutic avenues for UC management.

Limitations and Considerations
Despite its utility, the DSS-induced colitis model has several limitations. The acute colitis induced by DSS primarily reflects epithelial barrier dysfunction and innate immune activation, differing from the chronic, immune-mediated pathology of human UC. Moreover, DSS-induced inflammation is highly dependent on factors such as DSS concentration, molecular weight, duration of administration, and animal strain, necessitating careful experimental optimization. To model chronic UC, repeated cycles of DSS administration are often employed, allowing for the study of sustained immune responses and fibrosis development.

Method
======
Mouse Model and DSS Administration
C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks old) were administered 2.5% DSS (w/v) in drinking water for 6 days to induce colitis, followed by regular water for 3 days before euthanasia. Body weight, stool consistency, and fecal blood were monitored daily to assess disease activity.

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Colon tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm for H&E staining. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using antibodies against CD45 (immune cell marker), Ly6G (neutrophil marker), and CD3 (T cell marker) to assess immune cell infiltration.

Flow Cytometry and scRNA-seq Analysis
Colonic lamina propria cells were isolated using enzymatic digestion and analyzed by flow cytometry using markers for neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+), macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+), and T cells (CD3+CD4+/CD8+). Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform, and data were processed with Seurat and Scanpy to identify differentially expressed genes and immune cell subsets.
