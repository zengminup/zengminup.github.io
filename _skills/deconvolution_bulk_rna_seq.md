Background
======
Deconvolution of Bulk-RNA-seq data is a crucial computational method for resolving the complex cellular heterogeneity within tissue samples. Bulk RNA sequencing provides valuable insights into gene expression across a tissue, but it is limited by its inability to differentiate contributions from the various cell types present. CIBERSORTx, a state-of-the-art tool, offers a solution by deconvoluting bulk RNA-seq data into the proportions of distinct cell types within a mixed sample. This approach is particularly vital for studying heterogeneous tissues, where different cell types might contribute differently to the overall gene expression profile.<br/>

CIBERSORTx leverages machine learning algorithms to estimate the relative abundance of specific cell types from a predefined reference gene expression signature matrix. By aligning the bulk gene expression data with known cell-type-specific markers, it enables precise quantification of the cellular composition, facilitating a deeper understanding of tissue architecture, disease mechanisms, and immune responses at the cellular level. This method can also be used to analyze complex diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions, where understanding the cellular composition is critical for therapeutic strategies.<br/>

In addition to its robust analytical power, CIBERSORTx offers features like the ability to work with both bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data, providing a versatile platform for researchers in multiple fields. The toolâ€™s incorporation of advanced deconvolution models, such as support vector machines and empirical Bayes methods, makes it an indispensable asset for bioinformaticians and immunologists seeking to unravel cellular dynamics in complex biological systems.<br/>
