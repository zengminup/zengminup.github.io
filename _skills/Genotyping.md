# PCR for Genotyping Method
## 1. Preparation of Storage Solution for Proteinase K<br>
Weigh out 0.121g of Tris and 0.222g of CaCl2, dissolve them in sterile ultrapure water. Adjust the pH to 7.5 with HCl and bring the volume up to 50 mL. Mix the prepared solution in a 1:1 ratio with glycerol. Use this mixture as a solvent to dissolve Proteinase K to a concentration of 20 mg/mL, and aliquot into 1.5 mL EP tubes.
## 2. Preparation of Lysis Buffer<br><img src='/images/excel2.png'><br>
a) Harvest the toes from mice approximately one week old according to their identification numbers. If the toes are either not numbered or insufficient in quantity, use tail tissue instead. Place the dissected tissues into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes corresponding to their numbers.<br>
b) Add 100 µL of lysis buffer and 1 µL of Proteinase K to each tube, then securely close the caps.<br>
c) Incubate in a 56°C water bath for 4 hours.<br>
d) Remove the centrifuge tubes and check if the tissues are fully lysed. After vortexing, add 500 µL of sterile ultrapure water to each tube. Store the tubes in a 4°C refrigerator; the resulting solution can then be used as a template for PCR identification.<br>
3. PCR Identification of Mouse Tail Tissue<br>
a) Sequentially add sterile ultrapure water, PCR buffer, dNTPs, primers for the target genotype, and the DNA template along with controls to each PCR tube according to the reaction setup.<br>
b) Centrifuge the PCR tubes and remove air bubbles, then place them into the PCR machine for amplification.<br>
c) Perform DNA gel electrophoresis to observe the bands and determine the size to identify the mouse genotype.<br>
d) If identification of reporter mice is not possible, perform flow cytometry on blood samples from the mouse tail for further analysis.<br>

# Flow Cytometry for Genotyping Method
## 1. Follow flow cytometry method, brief as follows:<br>
a) Blood in 100ul EDTA<br>
b) Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution 500ul for 5min<br>
c) Terminate with 500 µL of PBS<br>
d) Centrifuge at 1600 RPM for 6 minutes<br>
e) discard the supernatant, and carefully aspirate 800 µL<br>
f) Using flow cytometry, Tdt-PE, Zsgreen-FITC
