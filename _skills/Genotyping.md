## PCR for Genotyping Method
1. Check the expression of canonical cell type and cell state markers in these clusters;
2. Identify signature genes, or marker genes, of each identified cell cluster. Based on the identified cluster marker genes, one can do literature search, enrichment analysis or do experiment (or ask people around) for annotation;
3. For each cluster, compare its gene expression profile with existing reference data.
