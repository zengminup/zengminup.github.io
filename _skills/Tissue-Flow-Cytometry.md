# Intestinal Lamina Propria Lymphocytes (LPL)
## 1. Preparing a Buffer Solution<br><img src='/images/Tissue-Flow-Cytometry-Buffer.png'><br>
Collect the small intestine and colon from the mouse, flush them, remove the fat, cut them open longitudinally, and rinse thoroughly.(PBS)<br>
## 2. Preprocessing
Cut the intestine into small pieces and place them into a 50 mL EP tube containing Buffer 1. Position the tube horizontally in a shaker at 37°C, 220 RPM, for 20 minutes.<br>
## 3. Washing
After 20 minutes with Buffer1, wash with Buffer2 three times: vortex each time for 10 seconds followed by vigorous shaking, repeating this process for three cycles.
## 4. Enzymatic Digestion
After Buffer2 is completed, transfer the intestines into Buffer3, incubate on a shaker at 220 RPM for 45 minutes.
## 5. Grind
After Buffer3 is completed, grind using a 360-mesh sieve and a grinding rod until the total volume is 40 ml, then centrifuge at 1600 RPM for 6 minutes.
## 6. Resuspend the Solution
After centrifugation, remove the supernatant. For small intestine samples, resuspend to 4 ml; for colon samples, resuspend to 2 ml. For small intestine, transfer 500 µl through a 200-mesh sieve into a new flow cytometry tube. For colon, transfer 1 ml. Add PBS to the new flow cytometry tube, then centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 minutes. After centrifugation, remove the supernatant. The remaining approximately 50 µl is the single-cell suspension. Perform surface staining, fixation and permeabilization, and transcription factor staining (if there is cytokine stimulation, lyse red blood cells before stimulation and use PMA/Ionomycin, Monensin/PFA, etc., as needed, then surface staining, fixation and permeabilization, and transcription factor/cytokines staining).<br>
And other tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry by differernt condition (Col P, Percoll)
