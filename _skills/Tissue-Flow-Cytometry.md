Background
======
## Tissue Flow Cytometry for Surface Markers, Transcription Factors, and Cytokines
Tissue flow cytometry is a sophisticated analytical technique that enables the high-throughput quantification and characterization of cellular phenotypes and functional states within complex tissue samples. By leveraging fluorescently labeled antibodies and advanced cytometric instrumentation, this method allows for the simultaneous detection of surface markers, intracellular transcription factors, and cytokines at single-cell resolution. This capability makes it an indispensable tool for dissecting cellular heterogeneity, identifying rare cell populations, and elucidating molecular mechanisms in health and disease.<br/>

The principle of tissue flow cytometry involves the enzymatic or mechanical dissociation of tissues into single-cell suspensions, followed by staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies targeting specific proteins of interest. Surface markers provide critical information about cell identity and lineage, while intracellular staining for transcription factors and cytokines reveals insights into cellular activation states, signaling pathways, and functional responses. Modern flow cytometers equipped with multiple lasers and detectors enable the simultaneous analysis of dozens of parameters, facilitating comprehensive immunophenotyping and functional profiling.<br/>

In the context of immunology, tissue flow cytometry has revolutionized our understanding of immune cell dynamics, particularly in tissues such as lymph nodes, spleen, and tumor microenvironments. It has been widely employed to characterize immune cell subsets (e.g., T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells), assess their activation and differentiation status, and measure cytokine production in response to stimuli. For example, this technique has been pivotal in identifying immune checkpoint expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, profiling Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profiles, and studying the role of transcription factors like FoxP3 in regulatory T cell function.<br/>

Method
======
# Intestinal Lamina Propria Lymphocytes (LPL)
## 1. Preparing a Buffer Solution<br><img src='/images/Tissue-Flow-Cytometry-Buffer.png'><br/>
Collect the small intestine and colon from the mouse, flush them, remove the fat, cut them open longitudinally, and rinse thoroughly.(PBS)<br/>
## 2. Preprocessing
Cut the intestine into small pieces and place them into a 50 mL EP tube containing Buffer 1. Position the tube horizontally in a shaker at 37°C, 220 RPM, for 20 minutes.<br/>
## 3. Washing
After 20 minutes with Buffer1, wash with Buffer2 three times: vortex each time for 10 seconds followed by vigorous shaking, repeating this process for three cycles.<br/>
## 4. Enzymatic Digestion
After Buffer2 is completed, transfer the intestines into Buffer3, incubate on a shaker at 220 RPM for 45 minutes.<br/>
## 5. Grind
After Buffer3 is completed, grind using a 360-mesh sieve and a grinding rod until the total volume is 40 ml, then centrifuge at 1600 RPM for 6 minutes.<br/>
## 6. Resuspend the Solution
After centrifugation, remove the supernatant. For small intestine samples, resuspend to 4 ml; for colon samples, resuspend to 2 ml. For small intestine, transfer 500 µl through a 200-mesh sieve into a new flow cytometry tube. For colon, transfer 1 ml. Add PBS to the new flow cytometry tube, then centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 minutes. After centrifugation, remove the supernatant. The remaining approximately 50 µl is the single-cell suspension. Perform surface staining, fixation and permeabilization, and transcription factor staining (if there is cytokine stimulation, lyse red blood cells before stimulation and use PMA/Ionomycin, Monensin/PFA, etc., as needed, then surface staining, fixation and permeabilization, and transcription factor/cytokines staining).<br/>
And other tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry by differernt condition (Col P, Percoll)
