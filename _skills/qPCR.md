### Quantitative PCR (qPCR): Background and Relevance to Intestinal Immunology

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), also referred to as real-time PCR, is a widely adopted molecular technique for the accurate and dynamic quantification of nucleic acids. Since its inception, qPCR has become indispensable in molecular biology due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and ability to monitor amplification in real time. It is especially valued for gene expression analysis, pathogen detection, and validation of high-throughput sequencing data.

The qPCR workflow involves amplification of target DNA sequences using traditional PCR chemistry, with the concurrent detection of fluorescence emitted by sequence-specific probes (e.g., TaqMan) or intercalating dyes (e.g., SYBR Green). The fluorescence signal increases proportionally with the accumulation of PCR products, allowing quantification during the exponential phase of the reaction. The cycle threshold (Ct) value—the number of cycles required for the fluorescence signal to cross a defined threshold—is inversely proportional to the initial quantity of the target template.

Owing to its speed, precision, and scalability, qPCR is routinely used in a range of biological and clinical applications. These include differential gene expression analysis, detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variation, and microbial load quantification. Its closed-tube format also minimizes contamination risks, making it suitable for both laboratory and diagnostic environments.<br>

In intestinal immunology, qPCR serves as a cornerstone technique for dissecting complex immune responses. It enables quantification of key cytokines (e.g., *Il18*, *Il17a*, *Il22*), transcription factors (e.g., *Tbx21*, *Rorc*, *Gata3*), and surface markers in immune cell subsets such as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), lamina propria lymphocytes, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). This is particularly relevant for elucidating mechanisms of gut immune homeostasis and the pathophysiology of disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Moreover, qPCR is commonly employed to validate gene signatures identified through transcriptomic approaches, thereby reinforcing its role as both a primary and confirmatory method in mucosal immunology research.<br>

Taken together, qPCR provides a robust and versatile platform for quantitative molecular analysis, making it an essential tool in the study of intestinal immune function and disease.<br>

#### Tissue Collection and Processing  
Colonic tissues were harvested from mice subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced epithelial injury. Following euthanasia, distal colon segments were excised, gently flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to eliminate luminal content, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until further processing.<br>

#### RNA Isolation  
Total RNA was extracted using a guanidinium thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform-based method, following standard protocols optimized for tissue samples. Briefly, frozen tissues were homogenized in a monophasic solution containing guanidinium thiocyanate and phenol, followed by phase separation through the addition of chloroform. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase containing RNA was collected and subjected to isopropanol-mediated precipitation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in RNase-free water. RNA concentration and purity were assessed spectrophotometrically, and RNA integrity was confirmed via denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.<br>

#### cDNA Synthesis  
Reverse transcription was performed using 1 µg of total RNA per reaction. A one-step protocol incorporating genomic DNA removal was applied to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) under standardized reaction conditions. Synthesized cDNA was diluted and used directly as template in subsequent quantitative analyses.<br>

#### Quantitative PCR Analysis  
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out using a SYBR Green–based detection chemistry in a 96-well plate format. Each reaction consisted of diluted cDNA template, gene-specific forward and reverse primers, and a double-stranded DNA–binding fluorescent master mix, in a final volume of 20 µL. Thermal cycling was conducted using standard conditions, including an initial denaturation step, followed by 40 cycles of amplification. Specificity of the amplification products was verified by post-amplification melting curve analysis.<br>

Transcript levels of mucosal-associated genes (e.g., *Fut2*, *Reg3g*, and related targets) were assessed. Expression values were normalized to the housekeeping gene *Hprt*, which demonstrated stable expression across experimental groups. Relative gene expression was calculated using the comparative Ct (2^–ΔΔCt) method. All reactions were performed in technical triplicates with multiple biological replicates to ensure reliability and reproducibility of the results.<br>
