**Welcome To My Academic Homepage**
I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in **Immunology** at [**Peking University**](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/pku.png' style='width: 6em;'>, which is ranked **#14 globally** in the [QS World University Rankings 2024](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/peking-university). I am grateful for the guidance of **Dr. Chao Zhong**, a distinguished researcher and **principal author** whose work has been published in **Immunity**, **Nature Immunology**, and **Nature Metabolism**, et al. <br/>

During my student career, I have served as a reviewer for **Heliyon** and **Annals of Palliative Medicine**. I have published 6 papers, primarily focusing on **Immunology**, **Metabolism**, and **Bioinformatics**. For example, my work has been published in **[Development Cell](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/developmental-cell)** and **[Journal of Diabetes Research](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jdr/)**.
