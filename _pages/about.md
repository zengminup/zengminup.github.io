**Welcome To My Academic Homepage**<br/><br/>
**[I am](https://zengminup.github.io/cv/)** currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in **Systems Biomedicine/Immunology** at **Peking University**  <img src='images/about/PKU.png' style='width: 6em;'> , which is ranked **#14** globally in the QS World University Rankings 2025. I am grateful for the guidance of [**Dr. Chao Zhong**](https://sbms.bjmu.edu.cn/jsdw/bssds/Chao_Zhong.html), a distinguished researcher and principal author whose work about ILCs has been published in *Immunity*, *Nature Immunology*, and *Nature Metabolism, et al*. <br/><br/>

During my student career, I have served as an academic reviewer for **Heliyon** and **Annals of Palliative Medicine**. I have published 6 papers, primarily focusing on **Immunology**, **Metabolism**, and **Bioinformatics**. For example, my work has been published in ***[Development Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1534580724002685)*** and ***[Annals of Palliative Medicine](https://apm.amegroups.org/article/view/64216/html)***. Other publications can be found in the **[Publication](https://zengminup.github.io/publications/)** section or **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=wkBkJnsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)** [![Citations](https://img.shields.io/badge/Citations-57-blue?logo=google-scholar&logoColor=white&labelColor=blue&color=lightgray)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citatons?user=wkBkJnsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).<br/><br/>

My research interests include **Intestinal/Skin ILCs and Helper T cells**, and my master's research topic is **[How Does IL-18 Promote Intestinal Homeostasis](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)**. The techniques I have mastered can be found in the **[Skills](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/)** section (Bioinformatics and Experiment), including **[Bulk RNA-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/bulk-rna-seq)**, **[scRNA-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/sc-rna-seq)**, **[Bulk ATAC-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/bulk-atac-seq)**, **[scATAC-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/posts/blog-sc-atac-seq/)**, **[Spatial Transcriptomics](https://zengminup.github.io/posts/blog-spatial-transcriptomics/)**, and **[Flow Cytometry](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/Genotyping)**, as well as other related techniques.<br/><br/>

I have been involved in several key research projects throughout my academic career. My work on **[Metabolism](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio_1/)** focuses on metabolism pathways, with a primary emphasis on understanding drug mechanisms and their effects on metabolic processes. In the field of **[Bioinformatics](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio_2/)**, I focus primarily on immune-related research, using techniques like RNA-seq, immune-related single-cell sequencing, and multi-omics analyses with both self-collected and public datasets. Additionally, I have contributed to research on **[Skin Innate Lymphoid Cells: Physiological and Pathological Roles](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio_4/)**, investigating their roles in both normal physiology and in autoimmune skin diseases. My current project, titled **[How IL-18 Promotes Intestinal Homeostasis](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)**, examines the role of IL-18 in regulating ILC3 function and its involvement in inflammatory bowel diseases. These projects collectively reflect my broad interests in Immunology, Metabolism, and Bioinformatics.I also document bioinformatics results and experimental data in my **[Blog posts](https://zengminup.github.io/year-archive/)**, which you can explore for more insights.<br/><br/>
