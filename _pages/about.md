**Welcome To My Academic Homepage**<br/><br/>
**[I](https://zengminup.github.io/cv/)** am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in **Immunology** at **Peking University**  <img src='images/about/PKU.png' style='width: 6em;'> , which is ranked **#14** globally in the QS World University Rankings 2025. I am grateful for the guidance of [**Dr. Chao Zhong**](https://sbms.bjmu.edu.cn/jsdw/bssds/Chao_Zhong.html), a distinguished researcher and principal author whose work about ILCs has been published in *Immunity*, *Nature Immunology*, and *Nature Metabolism*, et al. <br/>

During my student career, I have served as an academic reviewer for **Heliyon** and **Annals of Palliative Medicine**. I have published 6 papers, primarily focusing on **Immunology**, **Metabolism**, and **Bioinformatics**. For example, my work has been published in ***[Development Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1534580724002685)*** and ***[Annals of Palliative Medicine](https://apm.amegroups.org/article/view/64216/html)***. Other publications can be found in the **[Publication](https://zengminup.github.io/publications/)** section or **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wkBkJnsAAAAJ)** [![Citations](https://img.shields.io/badge/Citations-57-blue?logo=google-scholar&logoColor=white&labelColor=blue&color=lightgray)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wkBkJnsAAAAJ).<br/>

My research interests include **Intestinal/Skin ILCs and Helper T cells**, and my master's research topic is **[How Does IL-18 Promote Intestinal Homeostasis](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)**. The techniques I have mastered can be found in the **[Skills](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/)** section, including **[scRNA-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/sc-rna-seq)**, **[Spatial Transcriptomics](https://zengminup.github.io/posts/blog-spatial-transcriptomics/)**, **[ATAC-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/posts/blog-sc-atac-seq/)**, and **[Flow Cytometry](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/Genotyping)**, as well as other related techniques.<br/>
