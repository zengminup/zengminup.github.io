**Welcome To My Academic Homepage**<br/>
**[I am](https://zengminup.github.io/cv/)** currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in **Systems Biomedicine/Immunology** at **Peking University**  <img src='images/about/PKU.png' style='width: 6em;'> , which is ranked **#14**  (QS Rankings 2025). I am grateful for the guidance of [**Dr. Chao Zhong**](https://sbms.bjmu.edu.cn/jsdw/bssds/Chao_Zhong.html), a distinguished researcher and principal author whose work about ILCs has been published in *Immunity*, *Nature Immunology*, and *Nature Metabolism, et al*. <br/>

My research interests include **Mucosal immunity (Intestinal/Skin ILCs and Helper T cells)**, and my master's research topic is **[Interleukin-18 Mediates ILC3-to-ILC1 Transdifferentiation Driving Chronic Intestinal Inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)**. The techniques I have mastered can be found in the **[Skills](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/)** section (Bioinformatics and Experiment), including **[Bulk RNA-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/bulk-rna-seq)**, **[scRNA-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/sc-rna-seq)**, **[Bulk ATAC-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/bulk-atac-seq)**, **[scATAC-seq](https://zengminup.github.io/posts/blog-sc-atac-seq/)**, **[Spatial Transcriptomics](https://zengminup.github.io/posts/blog-spatial-transcriptomics/)**, and **[Flow Cytometry](https://zengminup.github.io/skills/Genotyping)**, PCR, qPCR, WB, Bacterial Culture and Disease Modeling, Mouse Management as well as other related techniques.<br/>

During my student career, I have served as an academic reviewer for **Heliyon** and **Annals of Palliative Medicine**. I have published 6 papers, primarily focusing on **Immunology**, **Metabolism**, and **Bioinformatics**. For example, my work has been published in ***[Development Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1534580724002685)*** and ***[Annals of Palliative Medicine](https://apm.amegroups.org/article/view/64216/html)***. Other publications can be found in the **[Publication](https://zengminup.github.io/publications/)** section or **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=wkBkJnsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)** 
[![Citations](https://img.shields.io/badge/Citations-68-blue?logo=google-scholar&logoColor=white&labelColor=blue&color=lightgray)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=wkBkJnsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).<br/>

I have been involved in several key research projects throughout my academic career. My current project, titled **[Interleukin-18 Mediates ILC3-to-ILC1 Transdifferentiation Driving Chronic Intestinal Inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)**, investigates how IL-18 regulates ILC3 function and contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. I have also conducted in-depth research on **[Skin Innate Lymphoid Cells: Physiological and Pathological Roles](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio_4/)**, exploring their functions in tissue homeostasis and their involvement in autoimmune skin disorders.<br/>

In the field of **[Bioinformatics](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio_2/)**, I focus on immune-related studies using RNA-seq, single-cell sequencing, and multi-omics approaches, integrating both self-generated and publicly available datasets. My work on **[Metabolism](https://zengminup.github.io/portfolio/portfolio_1/)** centers on metabolic pathways, with a particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms of drug action and their systemic effects.<br/> In addition, I regularly share my bioinformatics findings and experimental observations in **[blog posts](https://zengminup.github.io/year-archive/)**, offering insights into data interpretation and research progress.
