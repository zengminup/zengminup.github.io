Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident lymphocytes that lack rearranged antigen receptors. Cutaneous ILCs, mainly ILC2s, are essential for sustaining tissue equilibrium, contributing to physiological and pathological roles. Here, this review explores the characteristics of cutaneous ILCs in different conditions. This review highlights the role of skin ILCs in maintaining tissue homeostasis by regulating microbiome balance. It examines how their dysfunction can lead to inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and melanoma. ILC-related factors contribute to physiological functions and their implications in various pathological conditions, potentially highlighting key areas for future research. We now explore how these studies have enhanced our understanding of ILC regulation and the potential therapeutic applications of targeting these cells in skin inflammation based on microbiota and metabolism.
