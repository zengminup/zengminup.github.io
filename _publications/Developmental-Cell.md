In mice, skin-resident type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) exhibit some ILC3-like characteristics. However, the underlying mechanismremains elusive. Here, we observed lower expression of the ILC2 master regulator GATA3 specifically in cutaneous ILC2s (cILC2s) compared with canonical ILC2s, in line with its functionally divergent role in transcriptional control in cILC2s. Decreased levels of GATA3 enabled the expansion of RORgt fate-mapped (RORgtfm+) cILC2s after postnatal days, displaying certain similarities to ILC3s. Single- cell trajectory analysis showed a sequential promotion of the RORgtfm+ cILC2 divergency by RORgt and GATA3. Notably, during hair follicle recycling, these RORgtfm+ cILC2s accumulated around the hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) region to facilitate the process. Mechanistically, we found that GATA3-mediated integrin a3b1 upregulation on RORgtfm+ cILC2s was required for their positioning around the DP. Overall, our study demonstrates a distinct regulatory role of GATA3 in cILC2s, particularly in promoting the divergence of RORgtfm+ cILC2s to facilitate hair follicle recycling.<br/><img src='/images/developmental-cell-abstract.png'>
