To explore the pharmacological mechanism of essential formulas for the treatment of diabetes, and to guide the prevention and treatment of diabetes, based on multi-algorithm mining the medication rule of treating diabetes and based on bioinformatics.Methods The ancient and modern medical case cloud platform V2.3.5 was used for data mining about the prescription and medication rules of diabetes treatment, and it studied the new essential prescriptions based on algorithms such as association rules and cluster analysis. In addition, bioinformatics was used to analyze the pharmacological mechanism of the critical prescription in the treatment of diabetes.Results A total of 47 prescriptions were screened in the ancient and modern medical case cloud platform V2.3.5, 68 Chinese medicine prescriptions, 214 Chinese medicines and four new formulas were screened Based on network pharmacological analysis, it was found that the new prescriptions for the treatment of diabetes were based on 193 biologically active compounds, 30 key targets, 4151 GO processes and 74 KEGG biological pathways, glycyroside, sitosterol and other vital active ingredients were discovered based on molecular docking.Conclusion This study preliminarily clarifies the rules of prescriptions and medications for diabetes treatment and reveal the pharmacological mechanism of compound medications based on bioinformatics, and it provides data algorithm support and bioinformatics basis for the clinical dialectical treatment of diabetes in traditional Chinese medicine.<br/><img src='/images/Modernization-of-Traditional-Chinese-Medicine-and-Materia-Medica-World-Science-and-Technology.png'>
