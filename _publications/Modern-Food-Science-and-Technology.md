In order to compare the antidiabetic effects of the crude polysaccharides of iron stick yam and bergamot yam, the scavenging effects of the two kinds of crude polysaccharides on DPPH and PTIO free radicals, the inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase, and the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects were determined. Type 2 diabetes model rats were established, and metformin was used as the positive control drug. The EC50 values (μg/mL) of the two kinds of crude polysaccharides were 35.38 and 16.19 for DPPH radical scavenging (p<0.01), and 7869.17 and 8335.78 for PTIO radical scavenging (p<0.01), respectively, with the inhibition of α-glucosidase (18.85% and 15.73%, respectively) being insignificantly different (p>0.05). Compared with the model group, the iron stick yam group had decreased FBG, TC and LDL-C levels (by 24.38%, 28.44% and 44.68%, respectively; p<0.05, p<0.01), increased liver glycogen content (by 21.83%; p<0.05), and increased CAT and GSH-Px levels (by 363.36% and 43.67%, respectively; p<0.01). The bergamot yam group had decreased FBG, TG, TC and LDL-C levels (by 25.62%, 28.52%, 22.79% and 44.73%, respectively; p<0.05, p<0.01), and increased SOD and CAT levels (by 7.22% and 69.76%, respectively; p<0.05). The results indicated that the two crude polysaccharides had different antidiabetic mechanisms. The crude polysaccharide from iron stick yam exhibited more advantages in scavenging PTIO radicals, reducing hepatic glycogenolysis, and enhancing CAT and GSH-Px activities, whilst the crude polysaccharide from bergamot yam was more effective in scavenging DPPH radicals, reducing TG content, and enhancing SOD and CAT activities.
