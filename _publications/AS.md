Atherosclerosis (AS) is recognized not only as a disorder of lipid accumulation but also as a chronic inflammatory disease. Its pathogenesis involves a complex interplay of multiple risk factors, including dyslipidemia, genetic predisposition, and diabetes. Hallmark pathological features of AS include fibrous tissue proliferation, lipid deposition, and localized calcification. Patients with AS frequently develop vulnerable or erosive plaques, which may precipitate severe cardiovascular events such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and myocardial infarction. This review systematically explores the pathological features of AS, disruptions in lipid metabolism, the role of inflammatory and immune responses, and advances in genetically engineered animal models. By elucidating the intricate relationship between lipid dysregulation and inflammation, and by highlighting emerging therapeutic strategies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding that may inform the refinement of animal models and the development of more effective anti-atherosclerotic therapies.<br/>
