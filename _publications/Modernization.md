Objective To explored the molecular mechanism of the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway of the pharmacological effects of "Three Chinese Patent Medicines, Three Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula" in the treatment of COVID-19 and the traditional Chinese medicine connection of compounds′ medicinal flavor. Methods The ingredients, targets, and flavors of the Chinese herbal compound were obtained through the ETCM database. The STRING database was used to construct the protein interaction network. The DAVID and Metascape databases were used to enrich the target function. The Cytoscape software was used to construct and analyze the visual network diagram. Results "Three Chinese Patent Medicines, Three Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula" mainly focus on the spleen and lung meridians. The mild, common type compound prescriptions mainly focus on the lung and stomach meridians. In the severe stage, the compound prescriptions focus on the liver and heart meridians. In the common type, the proportion of compound cold medicines is the largest. "Three Chinese Patent Medicines, Three Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula" mainly include bitter, spicy, and sweet Chinese herb. Among the common compounds, alexandrin and NSP (N7-MTase), Oleanolic Acid and E protein (ion channel) have the good binding ability. The compound regulation has in common: it contains the common sub-module γ -aminobutyric acid receptor subunit interaction and the interaction of cytochrome, ATP-dependent transposase, and nuclear receptor, in the regulation of 16 biological pathways involved ① neuroprotection role; ② immune regulation and anti-inflammatory storm regulation; ③ endocrine regulation and sex hormone regulation; ④ energy metabolism regulation; ⑤ drug metabolism; ⑥ other pathways. Differences: "Three Chinese Patent Medicines, Three Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula" also have their specific regulatory pathways. Jinhua Qinggan Granule and Lianhua Qingwen Capsule participate in the regulation of ACE2 related pathway Reninangiotensin system, and 6 formulas have their common sub-module interacting proteins, respectively. Conclusion "Three Chinese Patent Medicines, Three Traditional Chinese Medicine Compounds" in the treatment of COVID-19 embodies the principles of TCM treatment based on syndrome differentiation and treatment, the treatment of the disease, righteousness within the qi, and prevention of the disease, and it preliminary reveals the functional regulation and similarities and differences of the Chinese herbal compound through network pharmacology. This study explains the comprehensive regulation of "Three Chinese Patent Medicines, Three Traditional Chinese Medicine Compounds" through multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway.
